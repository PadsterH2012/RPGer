## Basic Information

- **Class**: Magic-User
- **Level**: 5
- **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
- **Age**: 42
- **Gender**: Male
- **Occupation**: Former Imperial Scholar, now Cult Leader

## Physical Description
Morden Vex is a tall, gaunt man with pale skin and sharp features. His once-black hair is now streaked with gray and receding from his high forehead. He has intense gray eyes that seem to look through people rather than at them. He typically wears dark robes with subtle arcane symbols embroidered along the hems and carries a staff topped with a cloudy crystal.

A long scar runs from his right temple to his jaw, the result of an experiment gone wrong years ago. His hands are stained with various alchemical substances, and his fingers are unusually long and nimble.

## Personality
Morden is highly intelligent, methodical, and utterly obsessed with understanding and harnessing the magical energies released during the Sundering. He views himself as a visionary researcher rather than a villain, believing that his work will ultimately benefit humanity by reclaiming lost magical knowledge.

He is cold and calculating in his interactions, seeing most people as either tools to be used or obstacles to be removed. He can be charming and persuasive when necessary, particularly when recruiting new cult members or gathering information.

### Traits
- **Intellectual**: Values knowledge above all else
- **Obsessive**: Fixated on understanding the Sundering
- **Pragmatic**: Willing to sacrifice others for his goals
- **Paranoid**: Trusts very few people
- **Arrogant**: Believes himself intellectually superior to most

## Background
Morden was once a respected scholar at the Academy of Arcane Studies in Havencrest, specializing in historical magical events. His research into the Sundering led him to theorize that residual energy from the cataclysm still lingered at certain locations, particularly imperial sites that were active during the event.

When the Academy rejected his theories as dangerous and forbade further research, Morden continued in secret. An experiment to detect residual energy went wrong, scarring his face and killing his assistant. Branded a dangerous rogue mage, he fled Havencrest and went into hiding.

Over the past five years, he has gathered like-minded individuals and formed the Seekers of the Shattered Crown, a cult dedicated to harnessing the power of the Sundering. His research led him to the Imperial Outpost Ruins near Crossroads, where he discovered evidence of a powerful artifact buried beneath.

## Motivations
1. **Primary Goal**: Recover and master the Shard of Binding to control elemental forces
2. **Secondary Goal**: Vindicate his theories by demonstrating the power of Sundering energy
3. **Long-term Goal**: Locate other Sundering artifacts and eventually recreate aspects of the cataclysm under controlled conditions

## Relationships
- **The Veiled Conclave**: Has contacts within this secret society of mages, though they consider his methods extreme
- **Magistrate Eldon Voss**: Former acquaintance from Havencrest who would recognize him
- **Acolytes**: Treats his inner circle as students rather than servants
- **Cultists**: Views as expendable pawns, though maintains loyalty through promises of power

## Tactics

### Combat Tactics
Morden avoids direct combat whenever possible, preferring to let his minions handle physical threats. If forced to fight, he follows these tactics:

1. **Initial Defense**: Cast Shield if threatened, then retreat to a defensible position
2. **Control**: Use Sleep or Charm Person to neutralize weaker opponents
3. **Obstruction**: Cast Web to block pursuers or trap enemies
4. **Offense**: Use Magic Missile for reliable damage or Lightning Bolt in desperate situations
5. **Escape**: Use Invisibility to flee if overwhelmed

### Social Tactics
When interacting with others, Morden employs these approaches:

1. **Authority**: Projects confidence and superior knowledge to intimidate
2. **Manipulation**: Identifies others' desires and offers to fulfill them in exchange for cooperation
3. **Deception**: Presents himself as a researcher or archaeologist when dealing with strangers
4. **Recruitment**: Targets the disaffected, promising power and knowledge

## The Ritual
Morden has been preparing a complex ritual to activate the Shard of Binding. The ritual requires:

1. **Elemental Anchors**: Four specially prepared crystals placed at cardinal points
2. **Blood Sacrifice**: The life force of at least three individuals
3. **Incantation**: A lengthy spell combining elements of Conjuration and Evocation
4. **Timing**: Must be performed during the new moon

If successful, the ritual would give Morden control over local elemental forces, allowing him to create magical storms, earth tremors, and other phenomena. This would serve as both a proof of concept and a source of power for further experiments.

## Quotes
- "The Sundering wasn't just destructionâ€”it was transformation. Those fools at the Academy are too afraid to see the opportunity it presents."
- "Every great discovery requires sacrifice. History will vindicate my methods."
- "The empire harnessed only a fraction of magic's true potential. I will go further."
- "I offer you knowledge and power beyond your imagination. All I ask is your assistance with one small task..."
- "Kill them if you must, but the books and artifacts must remain undamaged!"

## Role in the Campaign
Morden serves as the initial antagonist, introducing players to the themes of lost imperial magic and the dangers of the Sundering. While he may be defeated at the Imperial Outpost Ruins, his research and cult connections can lead to further adventures.

If he survives the initial encounter, Morden could become a recurring villain, appearing at other sites of magical significance or sending agents to recover the Shard of Binding. His obsession with Sundering energy could eventually connect to larger threats within the campaign world.
