Key locations include the Sword Coast with cities like Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, the desert land of Anauroch, the exotic eastern realms of Kara-Tur, and the southern jungles of Chult.
*This setting works well with AD&D's traditional fantasy elements and provides extensive established lore while allowing flexibility for homebrew additions.*

### Setting 2: Dragonlance
A world shaped by the conflict between good and evil, where dragons play a central role in the world's mythology and current events. The continent of Ansalon features diverse nations recovering from a cataclysm that reshaped the world. The setting emphasizes the importance of balance between Order and Chaos, with the gods actively involved through their clerics and champions. Key locations include the Tower of High Sorcery, the dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin, and the elven forest of Qualinesti.
*This setting works well with AD&D's alignment system and dragon-focused adventures, providing a more defined narrative structure than some other settings.*

The setting emphasizes gothic horror elements, with vampires, werewolves, and other classic monsters as central threats. Each domain has its own distinct flavor of horror, from the vampire-ruled Barovia to the Jekyll-and-Hyde inspired Mordent.

*This setting works well with AD&D's horror elements and provides opportunities for atmosphere-focused adventures with moral complexity.*

### Setting 5: Dark Sun
A post-apocalyptic desert world called Athas where arcane magic has drained the planet of life, water and metal are scarce, and brutal sorcerer-kings rule city-states with iron fists. The setting features unique races and class variants adapted to the harsh environment, including half-giant gladiators and mul (dwarf-human hybrids). Psionics are common, while divine magic is rare due to the absence or death of traditional gods. Survival in the desert wastes is as much a challenge as confronting the setting's villains.
*This setting works well with AD&D's psionics rules and provides a distinctly different flavor from traditional fantasy.*

### Setting 6: Eberron
A world where magic has been industrialized, creating magical technology like lightning rails (magical trains) and warforged (sentient constructs).

*This setting works perfectly with AD&D's planar cosmology and provides opportunities for truly exotic adventures beyond traditional fantasy realms.*

### Setting 8: Spelljammer
A space fantasy setting where magical ships travel through "wildspace" between crystal spheres containing different worlds.

A setting where characters are scions of bloodlines imbued with the power of dead gods, giving them special abilities and the potential to rule domains. The setting focuses on both traditional adventures and domain management (ruling kingdoms, managing resources, and engaging in diplomacy or warfare). The continent of Cerilia features numerous human and non-human realms competing for power, while the ancient forest of the Aelvinnwode and the corrupted Gorgon's Crown present wilderness challenges.
*This setting works well with AD&D's higher-level play and provides a framework for characters to become rulers and shape the world around them.*

Key locations include the Forest Cities (former urban centers now massive woodlands), the Green Cathedrals (temples overtaken by sentient plants), and the Haven Towns (remaining human settlements).
*This setting works well with AD&D's druidic and natural themes while inverting the typical civilization/wilderness dynamic.*

### Setting 55: The Magical Industrial Revolution
A setting where magic has been systematized and industrialized, leading to mass-produced enchanted items, magical assembly lines, and arcane power sources replacing traditional labor. The setting features magical factories, worker movements responding to changing economic conditions, and the environmental and social consequences of mass magical production. Traditional artisan enchanters compete with industrial magical processes. Key locations include the Factory Districts (centers of magical production), the Mana Wells (industrial magical power sources), and the Artisan Quarters (where traditional magic resists industrialization).
*This setting works well with AD&D's magical item creation rules while exploring the consequences of scaling up such production beyond individual artisans.*
