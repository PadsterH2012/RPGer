### Trap 1: The False Floor Pit
A section of floor that appears solid but is actually a thin covering over a deep pit. The covering might be designed to break when weight is applied or to swing open like a trapdoor. The pit below might contain spikes, water, monsters, or simply be deep enough to cause falling damage.
*This classic trap works well with AD&D's saving throw mechanics and can be detected by careful testing of the floor or by noticing subtle signs of the false section.*

### Trap 2: The Poison Needle
A small, nearly invisible needle coated with poison, hidden in a lock, door handle, treasure chest clasp, or similar object that must be manipulated by hand. When touched, the needle extends and pricks the victim, delivering its poison.
*This subtle trap works well with AD&D's poison rules and thief skills for detecting and disarming traps.*

### Trap 3: The Rolling Boulder
A massive stone sphere released from a higher elevation, rolling down a corridor or slope toward the characters. The boulder might be triggered by a pressure plate, tripwire, or timed mechanism. Escape might require outrunning the boulder, finding a side passage, or pressing against the walls in a wider section.
*This dynamic trap creates interesting tactical challenges appropriate for AD&D's movement rules and saving throws.*

### Trap 4: The Flooding Chamber
A room designed to rapidly fill with water when a trigger is activated. The trigger might be entering the room, touching a specific object, or a timed mechanism.

Moving the statues incorrectly might trigger traps or animate them as hostile constructs.
*This physical puzzle works well with AD&D's strength checks and creates opportunities for both research and trial-and-error.*

### Trap 9: The Magical Reversal Field
A section of a room or corridor where magic functions in reverse—healing spells cause damage, damage spells heal, levitation pushes downward, etc. The field might be visible as a subtle distortion in the air or detectable only by its effects. Crossing the field safely requires understanding its properties and adapting strategies accordingly.
*This magical hazard works well with AD&D's spellcasting system and creates interesting tactical challenges for magic-using characters.*

### Puzzle 10: The Riddle Door
A door inscribed with a riddle that must be answered correctly to open. The riddle might relate to the dungeon's history, the nature of the treasure beyond, or a philosophical concept important to the dungeon's creators. Incorrect answers might trigger traps or summon guardians.
*This intellectual challenge works well with AD&D's emphasis on player skill and can provide lore about the dungeon or its creators.*

### Trap 11: The Symbol Trap
A magical symbol inscribed on a surface that activates when seen, read, or touched. The symbol might cause various effects: pain, stunning, sleep, fear, or even death. The symbol might be obvious or hidden, and might be bypassed by not looking directly at it, covering it before entering its area of effect, or using specific countermeasures.
*This magical trap works well with AD&D's symbol spells and saving throw mechanics.*

### Puzzle 12: The Weight Balance
A room containing a large scale or balance mechanism that must be properly weighted to unlock a door or deactivate a trap. The correct weights might be found throughout the dungeon, or common objects might need to be used in specific combinations.

Navigating the room requires timing movements with the gravity shifts or finding ways to anchor against multiple surfaces.
*This disorienting trap creates interesting tactical challenges appropriate for AD&D's saving throw mechanics and movement rules.*

### Puzzle 20: The Golem Guardian
A powerful construct that guards a passage or treasure, programmed with specific rules of engagement. Rather than being defeated through combat, the golem might require a passphrase, the completion of a task, or demonstration of a specific quality (courage, wisdom, etc.). Attempting to fight the golem directly might be futile or trigger additional defenses.
*This guardian-based puzzle works well with AD&D's golem creatures and encourages creative problem-solving over direct combat.*

*This timing-based trap creates interesting tactical challenges appropriate for AD&D's movement rules and spells like passwall.*

### Puzzle 74: The Magical Alignment
A puzzle requiring aligning objects, symbols, or energies according to magical principles—elemental oppositions, schools of magic, or metaphysical concepts like law and chaos. The correct alignment might be hinted at through magical diagrams, texts on magical theory, or the knowledge of sages with expertise in the relevant magical traditions.
*This conceptual puzzle works well with AD&D's magical systems and rewards knowledge of the game's magical principles.*

### Trap 75: The Mind Switch
A trap that switches the minds of those who trigger it, causing characters to inhabit each other's bodies. The switch might be temporary or permanent until reversed, and might affect all characters or only those who failed saving throws. Adjusting to the switch requires learning to use unfamiliar bodies and abilities, potentially with penalties until characters adapt. Reversing the effect might require finding the original trap mechanism, completing a specific ritual, or fulfilling conditions set by the trap's creator.
*This identity trap works well with AD&D's mind-affecting magic and creates interesting role-playing challenges as players must act as different characters.*

### Trap 76: The Magical Aging
A trap that rapidly ages victims, potentially reducing physical abilities, causing fatigue, or even threatening death from extreme old age. The aging might be temporary or permanent until reversed, and might affect all characters or only those who failed saving throws. The trap might be triggered by entering an area, touching an object, or casting certain types of magic. Reversing the effect might require specific rejuvenation magic, finding a fountain of youth within the dungeon, or completing a quest to restore youth.
*This transformative trap works well with AD&D's aging mechanics and creates interesting physical challenges as characters deal with aged bodies.*

### Puzzle 77: The Magical Synthesis
A puzzle requiring combining different magical components or essences to create a specific result.

*This crafting puzzle works well with AD&D's alchemy and magical item creation rules, rewarding both careful experimentation and knowledge of magical components.*

### Trap 78: The Illusory Floor
A section of floor that appears solid but is actually an illusion covering a pit, hazardous substance, or other danger. Unlike simple pit traps, the illusion might be sophisticated enough to resist casual inspection, respond to touch by creating false tactile sensations, or even temporarily support weight before failing. Detecting the illusion might require specific detection magic, careful testing of the floor, or noticing subtle inconsistencies in the illusion's appearance.
*This deceptive trap works well with AD&D's illusion magic and detection methods, rewarding careful investigation.*

### Puzzle 79: The Magical Conversion
A puzzle requiring converting energy or matter from one form to another to proceed. This might involve transforming elements (water to fire, earth to air, etc.), changing magical energies between schools, or altering the physical properties of objects. The necessary conversions might be achieved through spells, magical devices found nearby, or manipulation of the environment.
*This transformative puzzle works well with AD&D's transmutation magic and creates opportunities for creative use of spells and abilities.*

### Trap 80: The Dream Snare
A trap that pulls victims into a shared dreamscape or nightmare realm when triggered. Within the dream, normal physics might not apply, familiar objects might behave strangely, and dream logic might replace cause and effect. Escaping might require recognizing the dream state, finding a dream anchor that connects to the waking world, or defeating a nightmare entity that controls the dream. Time might pass differently in the dream, with what seems like hours or days taking only moments in the real world.
*This psychological trap works well with AD&D's dream-affecting magic and creates interesting narrative opportunities in the dreamscape.*

### Trap 81: The Magical Compulsion
A trap that magically compels victims to perform specific actions—speaking truthfully, following commands, or even attacking allies. The compulsion might be triggered by entering an area, touching an object, or making eye contact with a magical focus. Resisting the compulsion might require successful saving throws, finding and destroying the source of the magic, or fulfilling the compulsion in a technically correct but harmless way.
*This mind-affecting trap works well with AD&D's charm and compulsion spells and creates interesting role-playing challenges.*

### Puzzle 82: The Magical Attunement
A puzzle requiring attuning to specific magical energies or concepts to proceed. This might involve meditation in specific locations, channeling certain types of magical energy, or demonstrating understanding of magical principles. The attunement might be hinted at through arcane symbols, riddles, or the knowledge of sages with expertise in magical traditions.
*This magical puzzle works well with AD&D's spellcasting system and creates opportunities for spellcasters to use their knowledge.*

### Trap 83: The Magical Transformation
A trap that transforms victims into different creatures or forms when triggered. The transformation might be into stone (petrification), animals (polymorph), or other substances like gold or glass. The trap might be triggered by entering an area, touching an object, or meeting the gaze of a magical focus. Reversing the transformation might require specific spells, finding a magical cure within the dungeon, or completing a quest to break the effect.
*This transmutation trap works well with AD&D's polymorph and petrification effects and creates interesting challenges as characters adapt to new forms.*

### Puzzle 84: The Magical Puzzle Box
A container or device that must be manipulated in a specific sequence to open or activate.

### Trap 86: The Magical Darkness
A trap that creates magical darkness when triggered, potentially hiding other hazards or allowing hidden enemies to attack with advantage. The darkness might be absolute, resist normal light sources, or have additional effects like draining life energy or causing fear. The trap might be triggered by entering an area, touching an object, or using light sources above a certain brightness. Dispelling the darkness might require specific light-creating magic, finding and destroying the source of the darkness, or waiting for the effect to expire.
*This sensory trap works well with AD&D's darkness spells and creates interesting tactical disadvantages.*

### Puzzle 87: The Magical Combination Lock
A lock or barrier that requires activating multiple elements in a specific combination to open. Unlike a sequence lock, all elements must be activated simultaneously or held in specific states. This might require multiple party members working together, creative use of spells or items to hold elements in place, or finding a way to trigger multiple mechanisms at once. The correct combination might be hinted at through patterns, riddles, or clues found elsewhere in the dungeon.
*This cooperative puzzle works well with AD&D's party dynamics and creates opportunities for teamwork.*

### Trap 88: The Magical Vortex
A swirling vortex of magical energy that pulls victims toward it when triggered. The vortex might lead to another location, another plane of existence, or simply cause damage to those drawn in. The pull might be physical, affecting objects and creatures, or mental, compelling victims to willingly approach. Resisting the pull might require strength checks, anchoring to solid objects, or mental saving throws depending on the nature of the vortex.
*This force trap works well with AD&D's strength checks and saving throws, creating interesting tactical challenges.*

### Puzzle 89: The Magical Word
A puzzle requiring speaking a specific word or phrase to proceed. The word might be in a common language, an ancient or magical tongue, or might need to be spoken with specific intonation or by specific types of creatures. Discovering the word might require deciphering clues, researching the dungeon's history, or finding it written in a hidden location. Speaking incorrect words might trigger traps or strengthen the puzzle's protections.
*This linguistic puzzle works well with AD&D's language skills and creates opportunities for research and deduction.*

### Trap 90: The Magical Animation
A trap that animates nearby objects or substances to attack when triggered. Unlike standard animated objects, these might be materials not normally animated—sand forming into humanoid shapes, water rising as elementals, or shadows peeling from walls. The animation might be triggered by entering an area, touching specific objects, or using certain types of magic nearby. Defeating the animated threats might require destroying them, finding and disabling the animation source, or escaping the area of effect.
*This conjuration trap works well with AD&D's animated object and elemental summoning rules, creating unique combat challenges.*

### Puzzle 91: The Magical Riddle Gate
A door or barrier inscribed with a riddle that must be answered correctly to pass. The riddle might relate to the dungeon's history, the nature of what lies beyond, or abstract concepts important to the dungeon's creators. The answer might need to be spoken aloud, written in a specific location, or demonstrated through actions. Incorrect answers might trigger traps, strengthen the barrier, or summon guardians.
*This intellectual puzzle works well with AD&D's emphasis on player skill and creates opportunities for creative thinking.*

### Trap 92: The Magical Labyrinth
A maze enhanced by magical effects that make navigation especially challenging—shifting walls, teleportation triggers, or illusions that disguise the true paths. The labyrinth might change configuration based on time, actions taken within it, or seemingly random factors. Finding the correct path might require mapping the changes, identifying patterns in the shifts, or finding a magical guide or item that reveals the true nature of the maze.
*This navigational trap works well with AD&D's mapping challenges and creates interesting exploration puzzles.*

### Puzzle 93: The Magical Balance
A puzzle requiring balancing opposing forces or concepts—light and darkness, fire and ice, law and chaos, etc. The balance might be achieved through placing symbolic objects on scales, activating energy sources in equal measure, or ensuring equal representation of opposing elements. The correct balance might be hinted at through philosophical texts, patterns in the room's decoration, or the knowledge of sages with expertise in the relevant concepts.
*This conceptual puzzle works well with AD&D's alignment and elemental systems, rewarding knowledge of the game's metaphysical concepts.*

### Trap 94: The Magical Binding
A trap that magically restrains or immobilizes victims when triggered. The binding might be visible as glowing chains or bands of force, or might be invisible force holding victims in place. The trap might be triggered by entering an area, touching an object, or performing specific actions like casting spells. Breaking free might require strength checks, specific freedom-granting magic, or finding and disabling the source of the binding magic.
*This restraining trap works well with AD&D's hold person and similar spells, creating interesting tactical disadvantages.*

### Puzzle 95: The Magical Projection
A puzzle involving projecting light, shadow, or magical energy to create specific patterns on a surface. This might require positioning light sources, creating shadows with objects or bodies, or casting spells that produce the necessary energies. The correct pattern might be hinted at through diagrams, descriptions in texts, or trial and error with feedback from the puzzle mechanism.
*This visual puzzle works well with AD&D's light-based spells and creates opportunities for spatial reasoning.*

### Trap 96: The Magical Disintegration
A trap that disintegrates objects or creatures when triggered. The disintegration might affect specific types of materials, target certain categories of creatures, or destroy anything in its area of effect. The trap might be triggered by entering an area, touching an object, or using certain types of magic nearby. Avoiding the disintegration might require successful saving throws, finding safe zones within the affected area, or disabling the trap before it activates fully.
*This destructive trap works well with AD&D's disintegrate spell and creates high-stakes challenges.*

### Puzzle 97: The Magical Reconstruction
A puzzle requiring reassembling a broken or scattered object to proceed. The pieces might be physical fragments that must be physically arranged, magical essences that must be recombined, or conceptual elements that must be reunited. Finding all pieces might require exploring different areas of the dungeon, defeating guardians that hold pieces, or solving sub-puzzles to reveal hidden components. The correct assembly might be hinted at through patterns on the pieces, diagrams found elsewhere, or magical resonances between pieces that grow stronger as they approach their correct positions.
*This assembly puzzle works well with AD&D's item creation concepts and creates opportunities for exploration and deduction.*

### Trap 98: The Magical Transposition
A trap that switches the positions of creatures or objects when triggered. Unlike teleportation, transposition always exchanges the positions of two targets, potentially separating party members or placing them in dangerous situations. The trap might be triggered by entering specific areas, touching certain objects, or crossing invisible boundary lines. Predicting or controlling the transposition might require identifying patterns in previous switches, finding a map of linked locations, or disabling the magic creating the effect.
*This spatial trap works well with AD&D's teleportation concepts and creates interesting tactical challenges when party members are suddenly repositioned.*

### Puzzle 99: The Magical Sequence
A puzzle requiring performing actions in a specific sequence to proceed. Unlike a simple order of operations, the sequence might be complex, involve multiple steps for each action, or require precise timing between steps. The correct sequence might be hinted at through numbered clues, patterns that suggest order, or trial and error with feedback from the puzzle mechanism. Performing actions out of sequence might reset the puzzle, trigger traps, or strengthen the puzzle's protections.
*This procedural puzzle works well with AD&D's methodical problem-solving and creates opportunities for careful planning and execution.*

### Trap 100: The Magical Paradox
A trap based on a logical or magical paradox that creates dangerous effects when triggered. The paradox might cause reality to warp, create temporal loops, or tear holes in the fabric of existence. The trap might be triggered by attempting to solve an unsolvable puzzle, answering an unanswerable question, or creating a magical contradiction like casting opposing spells simultaneously. Escaping the effects might require thinking outside conventional logic, finding the flaw in the paradox, or simply fleeing the affected area before the worst effects manifest.
*This conceptual trap works well with AD&D's reality-bending magic and creates unique challenges that can't be solved through conventional means.*
