## Environment Description
The party is seated at a corner table in The Laughing Ogre Inn, a popular establishment in the town of Homelet. The common room is moderately busy with local patrons enjoying evening meals and drinks. A fire crackles in the large stone fireplace, casting warm light throughout the room. The innkeeper, Barret, occasionally glances at the party with interest, likely curious about their recent adventure.

The three rescued prisoners (Gareth, Mira, and Tomas) have been reunited with their families but have promised to meet the party tomorrow to provide any additional information they can recall. The atmosphere in town is tense as news of the goblin alliance and potential threat spreads.

## Recent Events Summary
The party explored the second level of the goblin caves, defeated a goblin shaman named Zargash and his followers, and rescued three prisoners from Homelet. They discovered evidence of a planned sacrifice to an entity called "The Dark One" scheduled for the full moon in two days. They also learned of an alliance forming between the goblins and hobgoblins, potentially threatening Homelet. The party returned to town with the rescued prisoners and are now resting at The Laughing Ogre Inn.

## Pending Decisions
1. Whether to inform Lord Mayor Bertram immediately or wait until morning
2. Which cave to explore next (hobgoblin caves are the logical choice)
3. How to prepare for the upcoming full moon and potential ritual
4. What to do with the unusual unholy symbol found in the shaman's chamber
