## Session Summary
The party continued their exploration of the Caves of Chaos, focusing on the second level of the goblin caves (Cave A). After defeating the guards at the entrance, they discovered a stairway leading down to the lower level. Thoric led the way, carefully checking for traps, and discovered a pit trap on the third step which they were able to avoid.

On the lower level, they encountered a larger goblin force led by a shaman named Zargash. A difficult battle ensued, with Mialee being severely wounded by a critical hit from a goblin archer. Zanthar's turning attempt failed, but his healing spells kept the party in the fight. Elindra's Sleep spell incapacitated three goblins, allowing the party to focus on the shaman.

After defeating the goblins, they discovered a prison cell containing three human captives from the nearby village of Homelet. The prisoners revealed that the goblins were planning to sacrifice them to "The Dark One" during the next full moon. They also mentioned overhearing the goblins talking about an alliance with the hobgoblins in Cave D.

The party freed the prisoners and discovered the shaman's chamber, which contained various unholy symbols and a small chest with treasure. Thoric found a secret exit that led back to the ravine, allowing them to escort the prisoners safely back to Homelet.

## Key Decisions
1. The party decided to focus on clearing the goblin caves completely before moving to other caves
2. They chose to escort the prisoners back to Homelet immediately rather than continuing exploration
3. Agreed to return to investigate the connection between the goblins and "The Dark One"
