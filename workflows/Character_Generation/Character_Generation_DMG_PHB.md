# AD&D 1st Edition Character Generation Workflow

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step process for creating a character in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st Edition, following the official rules from both the Player's Handbook (PHB) and the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG).

## **Phase 1: Ability Score Generation**

1. Determine which method to use for generating ability scores (PHB p. 9, DMG p. 11)
   - Method I: Roll 3d6 for each ability in order
   - Method II: Roll 3d6 twelve times, assign highest six rolls

   - Strength (STR)
   - Intelligence (INT)
   - Wisdom (WIS)
   - Dexterity (DEX)
   - Constitution (CON)
