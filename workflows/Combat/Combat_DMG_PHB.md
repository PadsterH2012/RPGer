# AD&D 1st Edition Combat Workflow

This document provides a comprehensive, step-by-step process for resolving combat in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st Edition, following the official rules from both the Player's Handbook (PHB) and the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG).

## **Phase 1: Combat Initiation**
