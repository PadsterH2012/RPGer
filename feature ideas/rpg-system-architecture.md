# RPG System Architecture: Database and Campaign Generation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture for the RPGer system, focusing on database design, content organization, and the campaign generation approach. The system uses a pre-generation model where campaigns are created before gameplay, then AI agents work with this packaged information during gameplay.

## Database Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Permanent Database Stack**
   - MongoDB for structured data and document storage
   - Chroma for vector embeddings and semantic search
   - Redis for caching and real-time data access
   - Deployed as separate containers with persistent storage

2. **Data Persistence Strategy**
   - Docker volumes for all database containers
   - Automated backup system with rotation policy
   - Preseeding mechanism for container rebuilds
   - Separation of database services from application components

3. **Content Organization**
   - AD&D 1st Edition reference materials (DMG, PHB, MM)
   - Campaign content (worlds, storylines, NPCs, locations)
   - Player data (accounts, characters, session history)
   - System metadata (settings, logs, analytics)

## Comprehensive Database Schema

## Content Generation Approaches

### Novel Content Extraction

The system can leverage existing novels as a source of rich, authentic content patterns by:

1. **Extracting Patterns Rather Than Content**
   - Speech patterns and dialogue structures from characters
   - Physical description frameworks and techniques
   - Personality trait combinations and expressions
   - Environmental and weather description patterns
   - Interaction dynamics between different character types

2. **Strategic Transformation**
   - Combine elements from multiple sources to create original content
   - Replace specific details while preserving structural patterns
   - Adapt extracted patterns to fit the game world's context
   - Apply variations to avoid repetition while maintaining quality

3. **Database Population**
   - Create thousands of NPCs by mixing traits from different literary characters
   - Generate location descriptions using extracted environmental patterns
   - Build dialogue systems based on character speech patterns
   - Develop weather descriptions from literary sources

4. **Benefits**
   - Professional-quality descriptions and dialogue
   - Authentic-feeling character personalities and interactions
   - Efficient creation of vast amounts of content
   - Consistent style with endless variations

For more details, see the [Novel Content Extraction](novel-content-extraction.md) document.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1: Reference Material Integration**
   - Process AD&D rulebooks into structured data
   - Implement vector search for semantic queries
   - Create specialized retrievers for different agent types

2. **Phase 2: World Building Framework**
   - Develop schema for worlds, locations, and settlements
   - Create tools for generating and managing world elements
   - Implement visualization for maps and geography

3. **Phase 3: Narrative System**
   - Design storyline and NPC schemas
   - Create tools for narrative generation and management
   - Implement connections between narrative and world elements

4. **Phase 4: Campaign Generation**
   - Develop campaign packaging system
   - Create tools for campaign creation and editing
   - Implement validation and testing mechanisms

5. **Phase 5: Agent Integration**
   - Update agent prompts to utilize campaign packages
   - Implement specialized retrievers for different content types
   - Create context management for efficient token usage

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a flexible, scalable foundation for the RPGer system. By pre-generating campaigns and packaging them with appropriate metadata and relationships, the AI agents can focus on providing an engaging, consistent gameplay experience while still having the flexibility to adapt to player choices.

The separation of database services from application components ensures data persistence and facilitates system maintenance and expansion. The comprehensive schema design accommodates the rich content needed for immersive RPG experiences, from monsters and spells to worlds, storylines, and characters.
