# Map System Improvements

## Recent Improvements

### 1. Elevation-Based River Generation

Rivers now properly follow elevation contours, creating more realistic waterways that flow naturally from higher to lower elevations.

**Key Changes:**
- Rivers are generated starting from high elevation points (mountains and hills)
- River paths follow the natural gradient of the terrain
- Rivers get wider as they flow downhill, simulating tributary confluences
- Natural meandering is added through controlled randomness

**Implementation Details:**
- The `_trace_river_path` function in `RiversLayer` now uses a scoring system that combines:
  - Elevation gradient (lower elevations are preferred)
  - Randomness factor (controlled by `meander_factor` parameter)
  - Diagonal movement penalty (to avoid zigzag patterns)
- Rivers occasionally select suboptimal paths for more natural appearance
- River width increases based on distance from source and elevation drop

**Code Example:**
```python
# Calculate a score for this cell
# Lower elevation is better (multiplied by flow strength)
# Add randomness for meandering
randomness = np.random.uniform(-meander_factor, meander_factor)

# Diagonal movement should be slightly less preferred to avoid zigzag patterns
diagonal_penalty = 0.1 if dx != 0 and dy != 0 else 0

# Score combines elevation gradient and randomness
score = (elev * flow_strength) + randomness + diagonal_penalty
```

### 2. Improved Political Boundaries

Political boundaries now respect natural features, particularly water bodies, creating more realistic territory demarcations.

**Key Changes:**
- Political boundaries no longer extend into water areas
- Territory coloring is only applied to land areas
- Water bodies maintain their natural appearance regardless of political control

**Implementation Details:**
- Before applying territory tinting or drawing boundaries, the code checks if a pixel is water
- Water pixels are skipped during the political boundary rendering process
- This creates clean boundaries that follow coastlines naturally

**Code Example:**
```python
# Get terrain data to check if it's water
terrain_data = terrain_layer.get_data_at(x, y)
is_water = terrain_data.get("is_water", False) if terrain_data else False

# Skip drawing boundaries on water
if is_water:
    continue
```

### 3. Enhanced River Rendering

Rivers are now rendered with variable widths and natural appearance based on their flow volume and surrounding terrain.

**Key Changes:**
- Rivers are drawn with width proportional to their size value
- River size increases as elevation decreases
- Rivers have subtle color variations for a more natural appearance

**Implementation Details:**
- Rivers are sorted by elevation before rendering to ensure proper layering
- River width is calculated based on both the river's size value and the current elevation
- Color variations and edge effects create a more natural water appearance

**Code Example:**
```python
# For larger rivers, add some width based on elevation
# Rivers should be wider at lower elevations
effective_width = river_size + max(0, (1.0 - elevation/100) * 3)

if effective_width > 1.5:
    # Check surrounding pixels and add river effect if they're not already rivers
    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= nx < map_width and 0 <= ny < map_height:
            # Check if this is already a river pixel
            neighbor_data = rivers_layer.get_data_at(nx, ny)
            if not (neighbor_data and neighbor_data.get("has_river", False)):
                # Add a lighter blue "edge" to the river
                edge_blue = min(255, blue_intensity - 20)
                edge_green = min(255, green_intensity - 10)
                # Add the edge pixel
                map_img.putpixel((nx, ny), (65, edge_green, edge_blue))
```

## Seasonal Effects

The map system can be enhanced with seasonal variations that affect multiple aspects of the world:

### 1. Weather Patterns

Seasonal changes significantly impact weather patterns:

```python
def apply_seasonal_effects(weather_data, day_of_year, latitude):
    """Apply seasonal modifications to weather data"""
    # Determine season (Northern Hemisphere)
    # 0-90: Winter to Spring
    # 91-180: Spring to Summer
    # 181-270: Summer to Fall
    # 271-365: Fall to Winter
    season_progress = (day_of_year % 365) / 365.0

    # Temperature variations
    if 0.25 <= season_progress < 0.75:  # Spring and Summer
        # Warmer temperatures
        weather_data["temperature"] += 15 * math.sin((season_progress - 0.25) * 2 * math.pi)
    else:  # Fall and Winter
        # Colder temperatures
        weather_data["temperature"] -= 15 * math.sin((season_progress - 0.75) * 2 * math.pi)

    # Adjust for latitude (colder at higher latitudes)
    weather_data["temperature"] -= abs(latitude) * 0.5

    return weather_data
```

### 2. Daylight Hours

Seasons affect sunrise and sunset times, which impact gameplay:

```python
def calculate_daylight_hours(day_of_year, latitude):
    """Calculate daylight hours based on day of year and latitude"""
    # Calculate solar declination
    declination = 23.45 * math.sin(math.radians((360/365) * (day_of_year - 81)))

    # Calculate day length in hours
    if latitude * declination > 90:
        return 24  # Polar day
    elif latitude * declination < -90:
        return 0   # Polar night
    else:
        day_length = 24 - (24/math.pi) * math.acos(
            (math.sin(math.radians(-0.83)) +
             math.sin(math.radians(latitude)) * math.sin(math.radians(declination))) /
            (math.cos(math.radians(latitude)) * math.cos(math.radians(declination)))
        )
        return day_length
```

### 3. Visual Appearance

Seasons change how the world appears:

- **Spring**: Increased river flow from snowmelt, new vegetation
- **Summer**: Full vegetation, smaller rivers, dry plains
- **Fall**: Changing foliage colors, moderate river levels
- **Winter**: Snow cover on higher elevations, frozen water bodies

## Future Improvements

   - Add river deltas at ocean outlets
   - Create lakes where appropriate based on terrain

2. **Coastal Political Boundaries**

   - Implement seasonal variations in river size
   - Create waterfalls at sharp elevation changes

4. **Seasonal World Changes**
