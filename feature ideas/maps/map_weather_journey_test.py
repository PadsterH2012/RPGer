Map Weather Journey Test

This script demonstrates a complete test of the seed-based map system with dynamic weather,
simulating a 10-turn journey across the map with descriptive narration.

The test includes:
1. Creating a map with terrain, rivers, and settlements
2. Generating a dynamic weather system for the map
3. Visualizing the map with added details
4. Simulating a journey with descriptive narration at each step
