# Druid

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Class Overview

The druid is a subclass of cleric who serves as a priest of nature and natural balance. Druids revere nature in all its forms and draw their power from the natural world rather than from specific deities. They are guardians of the wilderness, protectors of natural balance, and masters of elemental and animal magic. Druids combine spellcasting abilities with specialized nature-based skills and knowledge.

## Requirements

**Ability Requirements:**
- Wisdom: 12 minimum
- Charisma: 15 minimum
- Other Abilities: No minimum requirements

**Prime Requisite:** Wisdom and Charisma (both)

**Races Allowed:** Humans, half-elves (to limited levels)

**Alignment Restrictions:** True Neutral only

## Class Features

### Hit Dice

Druids use 8-sided dice (d8) for hit points. They receive:
- 1d8 per level from levels 1-9
- +2 hit points per level after 9th level
- Constitution bonuses apply

### Armor and Weapons

Druids have significant restrictions on equipment:
- **Armor**: Limited to leather armor only
- **Shields**: May use wooden shields only
- **Weapons**: Limited to: club, dagger, dart, hammer, scimitar, sling, spear, staff

These restrictions exist because druids avoid using metal armor and weapons made primarily of metal, as these are considered unnatural.

Druids cast divine spells drawn from the natural world:
- Begin with access to 1st level spells at 1st level
- Must commune with nature to receive spells
- Do not use spell books
- Have access to all druidic spells of appropriate level

## Multi-classing and Dual-classing

### Multi-classing

Druids can multi-class with the following classes (non-humans only):
- Cleric/Druid (half-elves)
- Fighter/Druid (half-elves)
- Ranger/Druid (half-elves)

Multi-classed druids advance in both classes simultaneously, dividing experience points equally between all classes.

### Dual-classing

Human druids may dual-class, abandoning their druid class to begin advancing in a new class. Requirements:
- Must have a score of at least 15 in the prime requisites of the original class (Wisdom and Charisma)
- Must have a score of at least 17 in the prime requisite of the new class
- Must stop using druid abilities while advancing in the new class
- May resume using druid abilities once the character has advanced at least one level higher in the new class than the level attained as a druid

## Proficiencies

### Weapon Proficiencies

Druids receive weapon proficiencies as follows:
- Initial proficiencies: 2
- Additional proficiencies: 1 per 4 levels (at levels 5, 9, 13, etc.)
- Non-proficiency penalty: -3 to attack rolls

## Equipment Considerations

Druids should prioritize:
- Leather armor
- Wooden shield
- Permitted weapons (scimitar is a popular choice)
- Mistletoe (used as a divine focus for spellcasting)
- Holly and oak leaves (secondary divine foci)
- Wilderness survival gear
- Component pouch for spell materials

## Tactical Advice

- Use your knowledge of nature to advantage in wilderness settings
- Leverage animal and plant communication for information gathering
- Position yourself to support the party with spells
- At higher levels, use shapeshifting for scouting and mobility
- Remember that your role is to maintain balance, not just to defeat enemies

## Roleplaying Suggestions

Druids can come from many backgrounds:
- Raised in a druidic community from childhood
- Former clerics who found a deeper connection to nature
- Individuals who experienced a profound natural event
- Wilderness dwellers chosen by elder druids
- Those who sought refuge in nature from civilization

Consider your druid's approach to natural balance:
- Passive observer who intervenes only when necessary
- Active protector who seeks out threats to nature
- Teacher who educates others about respecting the natural world
- Hermit who minimizes contact with civilization
- Mediator between natural and civilized worlds

## Druidic Organization

The druidic order has a complex organizational structure:

### Circles
- Druids are organized into circles based on level and region
- Each circle has specific responsibilities and territories
- Regular gatherings (often at solstices and equinoxes) reinforce community

### Hierarchy
- Strict hierarchy exists at higher levels
- Advancement beyond 11th level requires challenging higher-level druids
- Only one Grand Druid exists at any time
- After serving as Grand Druid, a character may advance as a Hierophant Druid with special abilities

### Beliefs and Practices
- Reverence for nature in all its forms
- Belief in the balance of natural forces
- Observation of seasonal rituals and celestial events
- Use of natural materials for tools and implements
- Preservation of ancient knowledge through oral tradition

## Druidic Spells

Druids have access to a unique spell list that focuses on:
- **Animal Control and Communication**: Speak with animals, animal friendship
- **Plant Control and Growth**: Entangle, plant growth
- **Weather Manipulation**: Call lightning, control weather
- **Elemental Forces**: Produce flame, wall of fire
- **Divination through Nature**: Locate plants, predict weather
- **Healing and Protection**: Cure wounds, barkskin

Unlike clerical spells, druidic spells rarely have reversed forms, as druids view both creation and destruction as natural processes.

## The Druid's Role

The druid serves several important functions:

### In Wilderness Adventures
- Guide and navigator
- Provider of food and water
- Interpreter of natural phenomena
- Negotiator with natural creatures

### In Combat
- Controller of battlefield through plant and elemental spells
- Support caster with healing and protection
- Shapeshifter for reconnaissance and mobility
- Neutralizer of natural threats

### In Social Situations
- Voice for natural concerns
- Keeper of ancient knowledge
- Mediator in conflicts involving natural resources
- Advisor on matters of natural balance
