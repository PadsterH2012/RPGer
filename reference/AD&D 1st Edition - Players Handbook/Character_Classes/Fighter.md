# Fighter

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Class Overview

The fighter is a warrior, an individual dedicated to mastering the skills of weaponry, combat tactics, and the art of war. Fighters form the backbone of any party of adventurers, providing the muscle and front-line fighting ability necessary for survival in a dangerous world.

## Requirements

**Ability Requirements:**
- Strength: 9 minimum
- Other Abilities: No minimum requirements

**Prime Requisite:** Strength

**Races Allowed:** All races can be fighters

**Alignment Restrictions:** Fighters may be of any alignment

## Class Features

### Hit Dice

Fighters use 10-sided dice (d10) for hit points. They receive:
- 1d10 per level from levels 1-9
- +3 hit points per level after 9th level
- Constitution bonuses apply

### Armor and Weapons

Fighters can use:
- All types of armor, including plate mail
- All shields
- All weapons

### Combat Abilities

**Attacks Per Round:**
- 1 attack per round at levels 1-6
- 3 attacks per 2 rounds at levels 7-12
- 2 attacks per round at level 13+

**Weapon Specialization:** Fighters may specialize in a specific weapon, gaining bonuses to attack and damage rolls with that weapon.

**Exceptional Strength:** Fighter-type characters with 18 Strength may roll for exceptional strength (percentile roll), gaining additional bonuses.

**Combat Bonuses:** Fighters gain the best attack tables (to-hit matrices) of any class.

### Followers

At 9th level (Lord/Lady), a fighter who establishes a stronghold will attract followers:
- 2d6 Ã— 10 0-level soldiers
- Various higher-level fighters and other character types
- These followers serve out of loyalty and do not require payment beyond maintenance

### Stronghold

A fighter of 9th level or higher may establish a stronghold and control the surrounding territory. This typically includes:
- A castle or fortified structure
- Control of the surrounding lands (usually 4-6 square miles)
- The right to collect taxes from the local population
- Responsibility for the protection and administration of the domain

## Experience and Level Advancement

Fighters advance in levels by earning experience points through combat, treasure acquisition, and completing quests. As they advance, they gain improved combat abilities, better saving throws, and additional hit points.

For detailed information on Fighter experience requirements, hit dice, and level titles, see the [Character Class Tables](../Tables/Character_Class_Tables.md#fighter-experience-and-level-advancement).

### Saving Throws

Fighters have excellent saving throws against physical dangers like poison, paralyzation, and breath weapons, but are somewhat vulnerable to magical effects.

For detailed Fighter saving throw tables, see the [Combat Tables](../Tables/Combat_Tables.md#fighter-saving-throws).

## Weapon Specialization

Fighters may specialize in a specific weapon, gaining the following benefits:

1. +1 to hit with the specialized weapon
2. +2 to damage with the specialized weapon
3. Additional attacks per round with the specialized weapon:
   - 1st-6th level: 3 attacks per 2 rounds
   - 7th-12th level: 2 attacks per round
   - 13th+ level: 5 attacks per 2 rounds

Specialization requires the expenditure of weapon proficiency slots:
- Initial specialization: 2 weapon proficiency slots
- Further specialization (double specialization): 1 additional slot

## Multi-classing and Dual-classing

### Multi-classing

Fighters can multi-class with the following classes (non-humans only):
- Fighter/Cleric (dwarves, half-elves)
- Fighter/Magic-User (elves, half-elves)
- Fighter/Thief (all demi-humans)
- Fighter/Magic-User/Thief (elves, half-elves)
- Fighter/Cleric/Magic-User (half-elves)

Multi-classed fighters advance in both (or all) classes simultaneously, dividing experience points equally between all classes.

### Dual-classing

Human fighters may dual-class, abandoning their fighter class to begin advancing in a new class. Requirements:
- Must have a score of at least 15 in the prime requisite of the original class (Strength)
- Must have a score of at least 17 in the prime requisite of the new class
- Must stop using fighter abilities while advancing in the new class
- May resume using fighter abilities once the character has advanced at least one level higher in the new class than the level attained as a fighter

## Proficiencies

### Weapon Proficiencies

Fighters receive weapon proficiencies as follows:
- Initial proficiencies: 4
- Additional proficiencies: 1 per 3 levels (at levels 4, 7, 10, etc.)
- Non-proficiency penalty: -2 to attack rolls

### Non-Weapon Proficiencies

While the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook does not have a formal non-weapon proficiency system, fighters are typically skilled in:
- Animal handling
- Armorer
- Blacksmithing
- Bowyer/Fletcher
- Hunting
- Riding
- Swimming

## Tactical Advice

- Position yourself between enemies and weaker party members
- Use your high hit points and armor class to absorb damage
- Consider weapon specialization for increased combat effectiveness
- At higher levels, make use of multiple attacks per round
- Establish a stronghold at higher levels to gain followers and a base of operations

- Noble-born knights
- Self-taught wilderness warriors
- Gladiators or arena fighters
- Town guards or militia members
- Tribal champions

Consider your fighter's motivation for adventuring:
