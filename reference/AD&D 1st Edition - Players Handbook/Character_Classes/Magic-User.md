# Magic-User

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Class Overview

The magic-user is a practitioner of arcane magic, studying esoteric tomes and ancient scrolls to master the manipulation of magical energies. Magic-users are the primary spellcasters in AD&D, capable of unleashing powerful offensive spells, creating useful magical effects, and eventually bending reality to their will. While physically weak and limited in combat abilities, their magical prowess makes them formidable as they gain experience.

## Requirements

**Ability Requirements:**
- Intelligence: 9 minimum
- Other Abilities: No minimum requirements

**Prime Requisite:** Intelligence

**Races Allowed:** Humans, elves, half-elves, and gnomes can be magic-users

**Alignment Restrictions:** Magic-users may be of any alignment

## Class Features

### Hit Dice

Magic-users use 4-sided dice (d4) for hit points. They receive:
- 1d4 per level from levels 1-10
- +1 hit point per level after 10th level
- Constitution bonuses apply

### Armor and Weapons

Magic-users have severe restrictions on equipment:
- **Armor**: Cannot wear any armor
- **Shields**: Cannot use shields
- **Weapons**: Limited to dagger, dart, and staff

These restrictions exist because the complex gestures required for spellcasting are impossible while encumbered by armor, and magic-users receive minimal weapons training.

### Spell Abilities

Magic-users cast arcane spells through careful study and memorization:
- Begin with Read Magic and 1-4 additional 1st level spells in their spellbooks
- Must study spellbooks to memorize spells
- Memorized spells are forgotten once cast
- New spells can be added to spellbooks through research or finding scrolls
- Chance to learn new spells is based on Intelligence

### Spell Learning

Magic-users must roll to determine if they can learn a new spell:

- Chance is based on Intelligence (see Intelligence table)
- Each spell may be attempted only once
- Failed rolls mean the spell is too complex for the character to understand
- Minimum and maximum number of spells per level is determined by Intelligence

### Spell Components

Magic-user spells require specific components:
- **Verbal (V)**: Spoken words or sounds
- **Somatic (S)**: Precise hand and body movements
- **Material (M)**: Physical substances or objects

All components must be available for successful casting.

### Spell Research

At higher levels, magic-users can research new spells:
- Requires time, money, and a laboratory
- Base cost is 200 gp per spell level Ã— 1-4 weeks
- Success chance is 15% + 5% per caster level above minimum required to cast
- Failed research means time and money are wasted

### Scroll Creation

Magic-users of 7th level or higher can create spell scrolls:
- Requires 1 week per spell level
- Costs 100 gp per spell level
- Requires special inks and materials
- Success chance is 80% + 2% per level above 7th

### Magic Item Creation

At higher levels, magic-users can create permanent magic items:
- Requires formulas, rare ingredients, and specialized knowledge
- Typically available only to magic-users of 11th level or higher
- Costs and time requirements vary by item
- Process is detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide

### Followers

At 12th level (Wizard), a magic-user who establishes a stronghold will attract followers:
- 10-60 (5d12) 0-level followers
- Various apprentices and other magic-users
- These followers serve out of desire to learn magical secrets

### Stronghold

A magic-user of 12th level or higher may establish a stronghold:
- Usually a tower, fortress, or similar structure
- Often includes a laboratory, library, and magical defenses
- May be located in remote or unusual locations

## Multi-classing and Dual-classing

### Multi-classing

Magic-users can multi-class with the following classes (non-humans only):
- Fighter/Magic-User (elves, half-elves)
- Magic-User/Thief (elves, half-elves)
- Fighter/Magic-User/Thief (elves, half-elves)
- Cleric/Magic-User (half-elves)
- Fighter/Magic-User/Cleric (half-elves)

Multi-classed magic-users advance in both (or all) classes simultaneously, dividing experience points equally between all classes.

### Dual-classing

Human magic-users may dual-class, abandoning their magic-user class to begin advancing in a new class. Requirements:
- Must have a score of at least 15 in the prime requisite of the original class (Intelligence)
- Must have a score of at least 17 in the prime requisite of the new class
- Must stop using magic-user abilities while advancing in the new class
- May resume using magic-user abilities once the character has advanced at least one level higher in the new class than the level attained as a magic-user

## Proficiencies

### Weapon Proficiencies

Magic-users receive weapon proficiencies as follows:
- Initial proficiencies: 1
- Additional proficiencies: 1 per 5 levels (at levels 6, 11, 16, etc.)
- Non-proficiency penalty: -5 to attack rolls

## Equipment Considerations

Magic-users should prioritize:
- Spellbooks (essential for preparing spells)
- Spell components (required for casting)
- Dagger (primary weapon)
- Staff (secondary weapon)
- Scrolls and magical items when available
- Protective items to compensate for lack of armor

## Tactical Advice

- Position yourself behind fighters and other front-line characters
- Conserve spells for significant threats
- Use area-effect spells when enemies are grouped together
- Prepare a mix of offensive, defensive, and utility spells
- Consider escape options (Invisibility, Dimension Door) for emergencies
- At higher levels, use divination spells to gather information before encounters

## Roleplaying Suggestions

Magic-users can come from many backgrounds:
- Apprenticed to a master wizard
- Self-taught through discovered tomes
- Educated at a magical academy or university
- Inheritor of magical knowledge from family tradition
- Discoverer of innate magical talent later developed through study

Consider your magic-user's approach to magic:
- Scholarly and methodical
- Experimental and innovative
- Cautious and conservative
- Bold and ambitious
- Specialized in particular schools of magic

## Spell Schools

While not formalized in the 1st Edition rules, magic-user spells can be categorized into different schools of magic:

1. **Abjuration**: Protective spells (Shield, Protection from Evil)
2. **Alteration**: Spells that change properties of things (Enlarge, Polymorph)
3. **Conjuration/Summoning**: Bringing creatures or objects from elsewhere (Monster Summoning, Conjure Elemental)
4. **Divination**: Information-gathering spells (Detect Magic, Identify)
5. **Enchantment/Charm**: Mind-affecting spells (Charm Person, Sleep)
6. **Evocation/Invocation**: Energy-manipulating spells (Magic Missile, Fireball)
7. **Illusion/Phantasm**: Deceptive spells (Phantasmal Force, Invisibility)
8. **Necromancy**: Death-related magic (Animate Dead, Finger of Death)

Some magic-users may specialize in particular schools, though this is not a formal rule in 1st Edition.
