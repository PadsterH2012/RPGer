## Special Restrictions

Rangers have several unique restrictions:

### Party Size
- Rangers cannot hire men-at-arms, servants, or other followers until reaching 8th level
- Rangers cannot travel or adventure with a party of more than 3 other characters (excluding followers gained at 10th level)
- Violating these restrictions results in the loss of all ranger abilities until proper atonement is made

### Wealth
- Rangers may keep only those treasures and magic items necessary for personal maintenance, support, and goals
- Excess wealth must be donated to worthy causes (not necessarily charitable organizations)
- Rangers may not possess more than 10 magic items total

### Alignment
- Rangers must maintain Good alignment
- A ranger who changes alignment loses all ranger abilities
- Restoration of abilities requires atonement and a return to Good alignment

## Equipment Considerations

Rangers should prioritize:
- The best armor available (typically chain mail for wilderness travel)
- Primary melee weapon (often a long sword)
- Bow for ranged combat
- Wilderness survival gear
- Tracking tools
- Healing herbs and supplies

## Tactical Advice

- Use tracking abilities to locate enemies before they're aware of you
- Take advantage of stealth abilities in wilderness settings
- Position yourself to use your damage bonus against giant-class creatures
- At higher levels, use spells to supplement combat and tracking abilities
- Consider the terrain and use it to your advantage
- Remember your party size limitations when planning adventures

## Roleplaying Suggestions

Rangers can come from many backgrounds:
- Frontier scouts and guides
- Wilderness protectors
- Hunters of specific enemies (giant-kin, orcs, etc.)
- Guardians of sacred natural sites
- Avengers seeking to right a wrong against nature or their people
- Wanderers who found purpose in protecting the wilderness

Consider your ranger's approach to their role:
- Solitary guardian or part of a loose network
- Proactive hunter or reactive defender
- Comfortable in civilization or preferring to avoid it
- Focused on protecting nature, people, or both
- Relationship with druidic circles and nature deities
- Specific enemies or threats they focus on

## Special Abilities Details

### Giant-Class Creatures

The ranger's damage bonus applies to the following creature types:
- Giants (all types: hill, stone, frost, fire, cloud, storm)
- Ogres
- Ogre magi
- Trolls
- Titans

The bonus increases by +1 per ranger level, making rangers exceptionally effective against these foes.

### Tracking

The ranger's tracking ability is affected by various factors:

**Positive Modifiers:**
- Very soft ground: +10%
- Light rain in past 24 hours: +5%
- Trail less than 1 hour old: +15%
- Each additional creature in group being tracked: +2%

**Negative Modifiers:**
- Hard ground: -10%
- Heavy rain in past 24 hours: -25%
- Trail more than 24 hours old: -20%
- Creatures attempting to hide trail: -25%
- Each day since trail was made: -15%

### Spell Use

Rangers gain access to both druidic and magic-user spells at higher levels:

**Druidic Spells**: Focus on nature, weather, and animals. Rangers typically select spells that enhance their wilderness abilities.

**Magic-User Spells**: Rangers tend to choose utility and detection spells rather than direct damage spells.

Rangers must study and memorize spells just as druids and magic-users do, but they do not use spell books. Instead, they commune with nature to prepare druidic spells and study the fundamental patterns of magic for magic-user spells.

## Ranger Followers

At 10th level, rangers attract special followers. These arrive over time and might include:

**Animals:**
- 1-2 brown bears
- 1-8 wolves
- 1-6 hawks or falcons

**Humans and Demi-humans:**
- 2-12 1st level fighters
- 1-6 3rd level fighters
- 1-3 rangers of 2nd-5th level
- Possibly clerics or druids

**Special Creatures (rare):**
- Pegasus
- Unicorn (only for good-aligned female rangers)
- Dire wolf
- Other unusual but appropriate creatures

These followers serve willingly and do not expect payment, though the ranger is responsible for their well-being. If a follower is killed through negligence or foolish action, the ranger may lose other followers and be unable to attract replacements.
