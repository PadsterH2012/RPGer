# Thief

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Class Overview

The thief is a character who specializes in stealth, trickery, and specialized skills that allow them to overcome obstacles through cunning rather than brute force or magic. Thieves excel at disarming traps, picking locks, moving silently, hiding in shadows, and other activities requiring dexterity and subtlety. While not as powerful in direct combat as fighters or as versatile as spellcasters, thieves provide unique capabilities that make them invaluable members of any adventuring party.

## Requirements

**Ability Requirements:**
- Dexterity: 9 minimum
- Other Abilities: No minimum requirements

**Prime Requisite:** Dexterity

**Races Allowed:** All races can be thieves

**Alignment Restrictions:** Thieves cannot be Lawful Good

## Class Features

### Hit Dice

Thieves use 6-sided dice (d6) for hit points. They receive:
- 1d6 per level from levels 1-10
- +2 hit points per level after 10th level
- Constitution bonuses apply

### Armor and Weapons

Thieves have significant restrictions on equipment:
- **Armor**: Limited to leather armor only
- **Shields**: Cannot use shields
- **Weapons**: Can use any weapon, but are limited in proficiencies

These restrictions exist because heavier armor interferes with the thief's specialized skills.

### Thieving Abilities

Thieves possess a unique set of specialized skills:

#### Pick Pockets
The ability to remove items from a person without being noticed.
- Affected by target level/HD, encumbrance, and situational modifiers

#### Find/Remove Traps
The ability to locate and disarm traps on chests, doors, and similar objects.
- Finding and removing are separate actions

The ability to move without making noise.
- Success means creatures rely on sight or other senses to detect the thief
- Particularly useful for setting up backstab attacks

#### Hide in Shadows
The ability to conceal oneself in shadows or darkness.
- Requires actual shadows or darkness to hide in

- Requires quiet conditions and concentration
- Useful for detecting creatures or activity beyond barriers

- Becomes available at 4th level
- Allows reading of treasure maps, coded messages, etc.
- Does not grant the ability to speak the language

#### Thieving Ability Tables

Thieves have a unique set of skills that improve as they gain levels. These abilities are affected by the thief's race, Dexterity score, and armor worn.

For detailed information on thief skills, including:
- Base percentages by level
- Racial adjustments

## Multi-classing and Dual-classing

### Multi-classing

Thieves can multi-class with the following classes (non-humans only):
- Fighter/Thief (dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, halflings)
- Magic-User/Thief (elves, half-elves)
- Cleric/Thief (dwarves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs)
- Fighter/Magic-User/Thief (elves, half-elves)

Multi-classed thieves advance in both (or all) classes simultaneously, dividing experience points equally between all classes.

### Dual-classing

Human thieves may dual-class, abandoning their thief class to begin advancing in a new class. Requirements:
- Must have a score of at least 15 in the prime requisite of the original class (Dexterity)
- Must have a score of at least 17 in the prime requisite of the new class
- Must stop using thief abilities while advancing in the new class
- May resume using thief abilities once the character has advanced at least one level higher in the new class than the level attained as a thief

## Proficiencies

### Weapon Proficiencies

Thieves receive weapon proficiencies as follows:
- Initial proficiencies: 2
- Additional proficiencies: 1 per 4 levels (at levels 5, 9, 13, etc.)
- Non-proficiency penalty: -3 to attack rolls

## Equipment Considerations

Thieves should prioritize:
- Leather armor (only armor allowed)
- Thieves' picks and tools (essential for many abilities)
- Versatile weapons (short sword, dagger)
- Rope, grappling hook, and climbing gear
- Dark or muted clothing
- Small, valuable items that can be easily carried

## Tactical Advice

- Use stealth abilities to scout ahead and gather information
- Position yourself for backstab opportunities
- Focus on disarming traps and opening locks that others cannot
- Avoid direct combat when possible
- Use ranged weapons when direct combat is necessary
- Coordinate with spellcasters for distraction or support

## Roleplaying Suggestions

Thieves can come from many backgrounds:
- Street urchin or orphan who learned to survive by wit and stealth
- Professional burglar seeking greater challenges
- Scout or spy trained in infiltration
- Treasure hunter specializing in recovering lost artifacts
- Adventurer who values versatility and problem-solving
- Member of a thieves' guild on a special mission

Consider your thief's moral code:
- Not all thieves are immoral or greedy
- Some may steal only from those who can afford the loss
- Others may use their skills primarily for exploration rather than theft
- A thief might have a personal code about what they will or won't steal
- Some thieves may be motivated by the challenge rather than the reward

## Advancement and Improvement

### Improving Thieving Abilities

At each level, thieves receive 30 percentage points to distribute among their thieving abilities:
- No more than 15 points can be added to any one ability
- Points must be allocated when the new level is attained
- These points are in addition to the standard increases shown on the table

### Specialization

While not a formal rule, thieves may choose to specialize in certain abilities:
- Urban thieves might focus on Pick Pockets and Open Locks
- Dungeon explorers might emphasize Find/Remove Traps and Climb Walls
- Scouts and spies might concentrate on Move Silently and Hide in Shadows

### Guild Training

Membership in a thieves' guild may provide additional benefits:
- Access to training for specific abilities
- Information about potential targets
- Fences for stolen goods
- Protection from authorities
- Contacts and resources

However, guild membership also comes with obligations:
- Paying dues or a percentage of earnings
- Following guild rules and hierarchy
- Performing services for guild leaders
- Potential involvement in guild politics and rivalries
