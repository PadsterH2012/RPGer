# Multi-class and Dual-class Characters

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Overview

AD&D offers two distinct methods for characters to combine the abilities of different classes: multi-classing and dual-classing. These systems allow for greater character versatility and customization, but come with specific restrictions and requirements. Understanding the differences between these systems is essential for players who wish to create more complex characters.

## Multi-class Characters

### Basic Concept

Multi-class characters simultaneously advance in two or three classes, dividing their experience points equally among all classes. They gain the abilities, restrictions, and hit points of all classes, but advance more slowly in each class than single-classed characters.

### Availability

- **Available to**: Demi-humans only (elves, half-elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings, half-orcs)
- **Not available to**: Humans

### Experience Division

- Experience points are divided equally among all classes
- Example: A fighter/magic-user who earns 1,000 XP would apply 500 XP to fighter and 500 XP to magic-user

### Hit Points

- Roll hit dice for each class separately
- Average the results (round up)
- Example: A 1st level fighter/thief would roll 1d10 (fighter) and 1d6 (thief), then average the results

### Combat Abilities

- Use the most favorable combat table among all classes
- Weapon and armor restrictions apply based on the most restrictive class
- Example: A fighter/magic-user can only use weapons allowed to magic-users and cannot cast spells while wearing armor

### Saving Throws

- Use the most favorable saving throw for each category
- Example: A cleric/thief would use cleric saves vs. poison and thief saves vs. traps

### Level Advancement

- Each class advances according to its own experience table
- Demi-human level limits apply to each class
- Classes may advance at different rates, resulting in different levels for each class

### Ability Requirements

- Character must meet the minimum ability requirements for all classes
- Prime requisite bonuses apply to each class separately

### Armor and Weapon Restrictions

- Must adhere to the most restrictive armor and weapon limitations
- Exception: Elven fighter/magic-users can cast spells while wearing elven chain mail

### Available Multi-class Combinations

**Dwarf:**
- Fighter/Cleric
- Fighter/Thief
- Fighter/Assassin
- Cleric/Thief
- Cleric/Assassin

**Elf:**
- Fighter/Magic-User
- Fighter/Thief
- Fighter/Magic-User/Thief
- Magic-User/Thief

**Gnome:**
- Fighter/Illusionist

- Fighter/Magic-User
- Fighter/Magic-User/Cleric
- Fighter/Magic-User/Thief
- Cleric/Ranger

- Cleric/Assassin

## Dual-class Characters

### Basic Concept

Dual-class characters begin in one class, then switch to a new class. They stop advancing in their original class and begin advancing in the new class. Once they surpass their level in the original class, they can use abilities from both classes.

### Availability

- **Available to**: Humans only
- **Not available to**: Demi-humans

### Requirements

- Must have a score of at least 15 in the prime requisite(s) of the original class
- Must have a score of at least 17 in the prime requisite(s) of the new class
- Must be at least 2nd level in the original class (no minimum level for clerics)
- Cannot have previously changed classes

### Procedure

1. Stop advancing in the original class
2. Begin advancing as a 1st level character in the new class
3. While advancing in the new class, cannot use abilities from the original class
4. Once the character's level in the new class exceeds the level in the original class, can use abilities from both classes

### Hit Points

- Keep hit points from the original class
- Add hit points from the new class as levels are gained
- No averaging is performed

### Combat Abilities

- While advancing in the new class (before surpassing original class level), use combat table of the new class only
- After surpassing original class level, use the more favorable combat table

### Saving Throws

- While advancing in the new class (before surpassing original class level), use saving throws of the new class only
- After surpassing original class level, use the more favorable saving throws

### Armor and Weapon Restrictions

- Must adhere to the restrictions of the new class while advancing
- After surpassing original class level, still must adhere to restrictions when using abilities of a restricted class
- Example: A fighter who becomes a magic-user cannot cast spells while wearing armor, even after surpassing fighter level

### Experience Points

- Earn experience only for the new class
- Original class no longer advances
- No division of experience points

### Common Dual-class Combinations

**Fighter to Magic-User:**
- Combines combat prowess with arcane spellcasting
- Useful for characters who discover magical talent later in life
- Challenging due to armor restrictions for spellcasting

**Fighter to Cleric:**
- Combines combat skills with divine magic
- Relatively smooth transition due to similar armor and weapon proficiencies
- Useful for fighters who experience a religious conversion

**Thief to Magic-User:**
- Combines stealth and specialized skills with arcane magic
- Useful for thieves who discover magical aptitude
- Complementary abilities for dungeon exploration

**Magic-User to Cleric:**
- Combines arcane and divine spellcasting
- Provides greater versatility in magic
- Adds healing abilities to arcane knowledge

## Comparing Multi-class and Dual-class

### Advantages of Multi-classing

- Available from 1st level
- Simultaneous advancement in all classes
- Access to all class abilities throughout career
- No period of vulnerability while transitioning
- More combinations available

### Disadvantages of Multi-classing

- Slower advancement in all classes
- Subject to demi-human level limits
- Must adhere to all class restrictions simultaneously
- Experience points always divided
- Limited to demi-humans

### Advantages of Dual-classing

- No level limits (humans can advance to any level)

## Special Cases and Rules

### Spellcasting

**Multi-class Spellcasters:**

- Must adhere to all spellcasting restrictions of the new class
- After surpassing original level, can cast spells from both classes if applicable

### Thief Abilities

**Multi-class Thieves:**
- Use thief ability percentages based on thief level
- Penalties apply when wearing armor heavier than leather
- Can use thief abilities at any time

**Dual-class Thieves:**
- Cannot use thief abilities while advancing in new class (if thief was original class)
- After surpassing thief level, can use thief abilities even while using abilities of new class
- Armor restrictions still apply when using thief abilities

### Experience Bonuses

**Multi-class Characters:**
- Prime requisite bonuses apply to each class separately
- Example: A fighter/thief with 16 Strength and 16 Dexterity would get +10% to fighter XP and +10% to thief XP

**Dual-class Characters:**
- Prime requisite bonuses apply only to the current class
- Original class bonuses no longer apply

### Level Titles

**Multi-class Characters:**
- Use the title appropriate to their level in each class
- Example: A 3rd level fighter/2nd level magic-user would be a "Swordsman/Evoker"

**Dual-class Characters:**
- Use the title of their current active class
- After surpassing original class level, may use either title or a combined title
- Example: A 5th level fighter who becomes a 6th level magic-user might be called a "Warrior-Magician"

## Practical Considerations

### Character Creation

**Multi-class Characters:**
- Plan ability scores to meet requirements for all desired classes
- Consider racial level limits for each class
- Choose equipment that works with all class restrictions

**Dual-class Characters:**
- Start with high ability scores to meet dual-class requirements
- Plan the transition point carefully
- Consider how long the character will be without original abilities

### Advancement Planning

**Multi-class Characters:**
- Accept slower advancement in exchange for versatility
- Plan for the impact of level limits on long-term play
- Consider which class abilities complement each other

**Dual-class Characters:**
- Plan for the vulnerable period during transition
- Choose a transition point that minimizes risk
- Consider how original class abilities will enhance the new class

### Equipment Selection

**Multi-class Characters:**
- Choose weapons usable by all classes
- Armor selection limited by most restrictive class
- May need multiple sets of equipment for different situations

**Dual-class Characters:**
- May need to change equipment when changing class
- Consider storage for unusable equipment during transition
- Plan for eventual use of equipment from both classes

## Examples

### Multi-class Example

**Elven Fighter/Magic-User:**
- Divides XP equally between fighter and magic-user
- Limited to elven maximum of 7th level fighter and 11th level magic-user
- Can use fighter combat abilities and magic-user spells
- Cannot cast spells while wearing armor (except elven chain mail)
- Uses the better of fighter or magic-user saving throws for each category
- Averages hit points from both classes

### Dual-class Example

**Human Fighter to Magic-User:**
- Begins as a fighter and advances to 5th level
- Switches to magic-user, starting at 1st level
- Cannot use fighter abilities while advancing as a magic-user
- Once reaching 6th level as a magic-user, can use both fighter and magic-user abilities
- Must remove armor to cast spells, even after regaining fighter abilities
- Keeps fighter hit points and adds magic-user hit points as gained
