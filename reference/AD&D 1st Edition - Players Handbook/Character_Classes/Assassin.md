# Assassin

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Class Overview

The assassin is a subclass of thief who specializes in the art of killing. Assassins combine the stealth and skill of thieves with specialized training in disguise, poison use, and efficient killing techniques. They are masters of infiltration and elimination, capable of adopting false identities to get close to their targets before striking with deadly precision. While feared and often reviled, assassins fulfill a niche in the adventuring world where sometimes elimination is the most efficient solution.
