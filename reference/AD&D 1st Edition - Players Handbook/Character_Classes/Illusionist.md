# Illusionist

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Class Overview

The illusionist is a sub-class of magic-user who specializes in spells that alter perception, create phantasms, and manipulate light, sound, and sensory input. Illusionists are masters of deception, capable of creating convincing illusions that can confuse, frighten, or mislead opponents. While they lack the raw destructive power of other spellcasters, illusionists compensate with versatility, creativity, and the ability to overcome obstacles through misdirection and trickery.

## Requirements

**Ability Requirements:**
- Intelligence: 15 minimum
- Dexterity: 16 minimum
- Other Abilities: No minimum requirements

**Prime Requisite:** Intelligence

**Races Allowed:** Humans, gnomes (to limited levels)

**Alignment Restrictions:** Any alignment

## Class Features

### Hit Dice

Illusionists use 4-sided dice (d4) for hit points. They receive:
- 1d4 per level from levels 1-10
- +1 hit point per level after 10th level
- Constitution bonuses apply

### Armor and Weapons

Illusionists have severe restrictions on equipment:
- **Armor**: Cannot wear any armor
- **Shields**: Cannot use shields
- **Weapons**: Limited to dagger, dart, and staff

These restrictions exist because the complex gestures required for spellcasting are impossible while encumbered by armor, and illusionists receive minimal weapons training.

### Spell Abilities

Illusionists cast arcane spells focused on illusion and deception:
- Begin with Read Magic and 1-4 additional 1st level spells in their spellbooks
- Must study spellbooks to memorize spells
- Memorized spells are forgotten once cast
- New spells can be added to spellbooks through research or finding scrolls
- Chance to learn new spells is based on Intelligence

### Spell Learning

Illusionists must roll to determine if they can learn a new spell:

- Chance is based on Intelligence (see Intelligence table)
- Each spell may be attempted only once
- Failed rolls mean the spell is too complex for the character to understand
- Minimum and maximum number of spells per level is determined by Intelligence

### Spell Components

Illusionist spells require specific components:
- **Verbal (V)**: Spoken words or sounds
- **Somatic (S)**: Precise hand and body movements
- **Material (M)**: Physical substances or objects

All components must be available for successful casting.

### Spell Research

At higher levels, illusionists can research new spells:
- Requires time, money, and a laboratory
- Base cost is 200 gp per spell level Ã— 1-4 weeks
- Success chance is 15% + 5% per caster level above minimum required to cast
- Failed research means time and money are wasted

### Scroll Creation

Illusionists of 7th level or higher can create spell scrolls:
- Requires 1 week per spell level
- Costs 100 gp per spell level
- Requires special inks and materials
- Success chance is 80% + 2% per level above 7th

### Magic Item Creation

At higher levels, illusionists can create permanent magic items:
- Requires formulas, rare ingredients, and specialized knowledge
- Typically available only to illusionists of 11th level or higher
- Costs and time requirements vary by item
- Process is detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide
- Limited to items related to illusion, deception, and sensory manipulation

### Followers

At 10th level (Illusionist), an illusionist who establishes a tower will attract followers:
- 5-30 (5d6) 0-level followers
- Various apprentices and other illusionists
- These followers serve out of desire to learn magical secrets

### Stronghold

An illusionist of 10th level or higher may establish a stronghold:
- Usually a tower or similar structure

## Multi-classing and Dual-classing

### Multi-classing

Illusionists can multi-class with the following classes (non-humans only):
- Fighter/Illusionist (gnomes)
- Illusionist/Thief (gnomes)

Multi-classed illusionists advance in both classes simultaneously, dividing experience points equally between all classes.

### Dual-classing

Human illusionists may dual-class, abandoning their illusionist class to begin advancing in a new class. Requirements:
- Must have a score of at least 15 in the prime requisite of the original class (Intelligence)
- Must have a score of at least 17 in the prime requisite of the new class
- Must stop using illusionist abilities while advancing in the new class
- May resume using illusionist abilities once the character has advanced at least one level higher in the new class than the level attained as an illusionist

## Proficiencies

### Weapon Proficiencies

Illusionists receive weapon proficiencies as follows:
- Initial proficiencies: 1
- Additional proficiencies: 1 per 5 levels (at levels 6, 11, 16, etc.)
- Non-proficiency penalty: -5 to attack rolls

## Equipment Considerations

Illusionists should prioritize:
- Spellbooks (essential for preparing spells)
- Spell components (required for casting)
- Dagger (primary weapon)
- Staff (secondary weapon)
- Scrolls and magical items when available
- Protective items to compensate for lack of armor

## Tactical Advice

- Position yourself behind fighters and other front-line characters
- Use illusions to confuse and misdirect enemies
- Create phantom threats to divide enemy attention
- Use sensory illusions to gather information
- Combine illusions with real threats for maximum effectiveness
- Remember that intelligent creatures may disbelieve your illusions
