## Multi-classing and Dual-classing

### Multi-classing

Clerics can multi-class with the following classes (non-humans only):
- Cleric/Fighter (dwarves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs)
- Cleric/Ranger (half-elves)
- Cleric/Magic-User (half-elves)
- Cleric/Thief (dwarves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs)
- Cleric/Assassin (dwarves, gnomes, half-orcs)
- Cleric/Fighter/Magic-User (half-elves)

Multi-classed clerics advance in both (or all) classes simultaneously, dividing experience points equally between all classes.

### Dual-classing

Human clerics may dual-class, abandoning their cleric class to begin advancing in a new class. Requirements:
- Must have a score of at least 15 in the prime requisite of the original class (Wisdom)
- Must have a score of at least 17 in the prime requisite of the new class
- Must stop using cleric abilities while advancing in the new class
- May resume using cleric abilities once the character has advanced at least one level higher in the new class than the level attained as a cleric

## Proficiencies

### Weapon Proficiencies

Clerics receive weapon proficiencies as follows:
- Initial proficiencies: 2
- Additional proficiencies: 1 per 4 levels (at levels 5, 9, 13, etc.)
- Non-proficiency penalty: -3 to attack rolls

## Equipment Considerations

Clerics should prioritize:
- The best armor available (typically plate mail)
- A shield
- A primary weapon (typically a mace or war hammer)
- Holy symbol (essential for turning undead and spellcasting)
- Holy water
- Healing supplies

## Tactical Advice

- Position yourself where you can support both fighters and magic-users
- Use your turning ability against undead before engaging in melee
- Save healing spells for critical situations
- Consider your role as both a combatant and support character
- Establish a stronghold at higher levels to gain followers and religious influence

## Roleplaying Suggestions

Clerics can come from many backgrounds:
- Raised in a temple or monastery
- Called to service by a divine vision
- Former warrior who found faith
- Missionary spreading the word of their deity
- Temple guardian or protector
- Healer or community spiritual leader

Consider your cleric's religious motivations:
- Spreading the faith to new lands
- Combating enemies of the religion
- Seeking holy relics or artifacts
- Establishing new temples or shrines
- Serving as an example of the deity's teachings
- Seeking divine knowledge or enlightenment
