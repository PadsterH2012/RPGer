# Monk

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Class Overview

The monk is a martial artist who pursues perfection through the harmony of mind and body. Combining elements of the fighter and thief classes, monks are masters of unarmed combat who develop extraordinary abilities through rigorous training and meditation. They eschew material possessions and conventional weapons in favor of developing their own bodies as deadly and efficient weapons. Monks follow strict disciplines that grant them unique powers beyond those of ordinary mortals.

## Requirements

**Ability Requirements:**
- Strength: 15 minimum
- Intelligence: 15 minimum
- Wisdom: 15 minimum
- Dexterity: 15 minimum
- Constitution: 11 minimum

**Prime Requisite:** Dexterity and Wisdom (both)

**Races Allowed:** Humans only

**Alignment Restrictions:** Lawful only (Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, or Lawful Evil)

## Class Features

### Hit Dice

Monks use 4-sided dice (d4) for hit points. They receive:
- 2d4 at 1st level
- 1d4 per level from levels 2-16
- +2 hit points per level after 16th level
- Constitution bonuses apply

### Armor and Weapons

Monks have significant restrictions on equipment:
- **Armor**: Cannot wear any armor
- **Shields**: Cannot use shields
- **Weapons**: Limited to: bo stick, club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, hand axe, javelin, jo stick, pole arm, spear, and staff

These restrictions exist because armor interferes with movement and special abilities, and monks are trained to rely primarily on their unarmed combat skills.

### Unarmed Combat

Monks excel at fighting without weapons:

#### Unarmed Damage
As monks advance in level, their unarmed attacks become increasingly deadly:

| Level | Damage |
|-------|--------|
| 1-3   | 1d4    |
| 4-7   | 1d6    |
| 8-11  | 1d8    |
| 12-15 | 1d10   |
| 16+   | 2d6    |

#### Attacks Per Round
Monks gain additional unarmed attacks as they advance:

| Level | Attacks Per Round |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1-2   | 1                 |
| 3-6   | 3/2               |
| 7-10  | 2                 |
| 11-14 | 5/2               |
| 15+   | 3                 |

#### Combat Bonuses

#### Movement Rate

#### Armor Class
Monks have a natural Armor Class that improves with level, starting at AC 10 at 1st level and improving to AC -5 at 17th level. Dexterity bonuses apply to this base AC.

#### Thief Abilities
Monks possess several thief-like skills, including:
- Move Silently
- Hide in Shadows
- Hear Noise
- Climb Walls
- Open Locks
- Find/Remove Traps

These abilities improve as the monk gains levels. For the complete progression table, see the [Monk Abilities Tables](../Tables/Monk_Abilities_Tables.md#monk-thieving-abilities).

#### Stunning Attack
Monks can attempt to stun opponents:
- Must declare before attacking
- If attack hits, victim must save vs. paralyzation
- Failure means the victim is stunned for 1-6 segments

At 13th level, monks gain the ability to kill with a single blow:
- Can be attempted once per day
- Must declare before attacking
- If attack hits, victim must save vs. death magic
- Failure means instant death
