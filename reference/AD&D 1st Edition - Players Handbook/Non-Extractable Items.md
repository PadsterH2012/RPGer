2. **Table Reformatting**: Complex tables are reformatted to work in markdown while preserving the information
3. **Referencing**: References to page numbers are replaced with section references or links
4. **Terminology**: Game terminology and concepts are preserved as accurately as possible
5. **Organization**: The original organization of content is maintained where practical

This document will be updated as the extraction process continues and additional non-extractable items are identified.
