# Armor

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Armor Overview

Armor in AD&D provides protection by improving a character's Armor Class (AC). The standard unarmored Armor Class is 10, with lower numbers indicating better protection. Various types of armor provide different levels of protection, with corresponding weight, cost, and potential restrictions.

- **Specific Situations**: Cover, concealment, and special circumstances may temporarily modify AC

## Armor Descriptions

### Banded Armor
Banded armor consists of overlapping horizontal strips of metal sewn to a backing of leather and chain mail. It includes a helmet and provides good protection for the wearer's torso and limbs.

### Chain Mail
Chain mail consists of interlocking metal rings, forming a mesh that absorbs the impact of blows. It includes gauntlets and a helmet.

### Elfin Chain Mail
This rare magical armor is made by elven smiths using secret techniques. It is as light as leather armor but provides protection equivalent to chain mail. Unlike normal chain mail, elfin chain allows magic-users to cast spells while wearing it.

### Leather Armor
Leather armor consists of a tunic and leggings made from tanned and hardened leather. It is the lightest and most common form of armor.

### Padded Armor
Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting. It is inexpensive but bulky and susceptible to damage from fire.

### Plate Mail
Plate mail consists of shaped and fitted metal plates riveted and interlocked to cover the torso, limbs, and other vital areas, with chain mail protecting the joints. It includes gauntlets and a helmet and provides excellent protection.

### Ring Mail
Ring mail consists of leather armor with metal rings sewn onto it. It is more protective than plain leather but less effective than chain mail.

### Scale Mail
Scale mail consists of small overlapping metal plates sewn to a backing of leather and chain. It includes a helmet but is heavier and more restrictive than chain mail.

### Splint Mail
Splint mail consists of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather or cloth. It includes gauntlets and a helmet.

### Studded Leather
Studded leather consists of leather armor reinforced with close-set metal rivets. It provides better protection than plain leather while remaining relatively light.

### Shield
Shields are typically made of wood with metal reinforcement or entirely of metal. They are strapped to the forearm and gripped with the hand, actively deflecting attacks.

## Class Restrictions

### Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers

## Armor and Movement

Armor restricts movement based on its weight and bulk:

| Armor Type      | Maximum Movement Rate |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| No armor        | 12"                    |
| Leather, Elfin chain | 12"               |
| Chain mail, Ring mail, Studded leather, Padded armor, Banded armor | 9" |
| Plate mail, Scale mail, Splint mail | 6" |

Movement rates are further affected by:
- Encumbrance from carried equipment
- Terrain conditions
- Character race (some races have lower base movement rates)

## Donning and Removing Armor

The time required to don or remove armor varies by type:

| Armor Type      | Don Alone | Don with Help | Remove Alone | Remove with Help |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| Leather, Padded | 1 turn    | 5 rounds      | 2 rounds     | 2 rounds         |
| Ring, Studded   | 2 turns   | 1 turn        | 5 rounds     | 3 rounds         |
| Chain           | 5 turns   | 2 turns       | 1 turn       | 5 rounds         |
| Scale, Banded   | 8 turns   | 3 turns       | 2 turns      | 1 turn           |
| Plate, Splint   | 10 turns  | 4 turns       | 3 turns      | 1 turn           |
| Shield          | 1 round   | 1 round       | 1 round      | 1 round          |

*1 turn = 10 rounds = 10 minutes*

## Armor Maintenance

Armor requires regular maintenance to remain effective:
- **Cleaning**: Removing dirt, blood, and corrosive substances
- **Oiling**: Preventing rust and maintaining flexibility of metal parts
- **Repairs**: Fixing damaged sections after combat
- **Adjustments**: Ensuring proper fit for comfort and protection

Neglected armor may provide less protection or impose additional penalties at the DM's discretion.

## Armor and Environment

Different environments affect armor use:
- **Water**: Swimming in heavy armor is difficult or impossible
- **Extreme Heat**: Wearing metal armor in hot conditions can cause exhaustion
- **Extreme Cold**: Metal armor becomes painfully cold and may cause damage
- **Stealth Situations**: Heavier armors impose penalties to move silently

## Special Armor Types

### Field Plate
An improved version of plate mail that provides better protection (AC 2) but is more expensive (1,000+ gp).

### Full Plate
The best non-magical armor available, providing excellent protection (AC 1) but extremely expensive (4,000+ gp) and rare.

### Elfin Chain Mail
A magical armor that allows magic-users to cast spells while wearing it. It weighs half as much as regular chain mail but provides the same protection.

### Armor Decorations
Armor can be decorated or customized with:
- Family crests or personal symbols
- Precious metals or gems (increasing value but not protection)
- Distinctive coloration or patterns
- Religious symbols or inscriptions

## Purchasing Considerations

When purchasing armor, consider:
- **Cost**: Better armor is significantly more expensive
- **Weight**: Heavier armor reduces movement and contributes to encumbrance
- **Class Restrictions**: Ensure your class can use the armor
- **Availability**: Better armors may not be available in small settlements
- **Maintenance Costs**: Higher quality armor may require specialized maintenance

## Armor and Combat

### Armor Class and Combat
- Lower AC numbers make a character harder to hit
- AC can be temporarily modified by combat situations
- Some attacks ignore armor (e.g., certain spells)
- Critical hits may bypass armor protection

### Armor vs. Weapon Types
The DM may use optional rules for weapon effectiveness against different armor types:
- Bludgeoning weapons may be more effective against plate armor
- Piercing weapons may be more effective against chain and leather
- Slashing weapons may be more effective against padded and leather

## Magical Armor

Magical armor provides enhanced protection:
- **Bonus to AC**: +1, +2, etc. (e.g., Plate Mail +1 provides AC 2)
- **Special Properties**: Resistance to certain attack forms
- **Curses**: Some magical armor may be cursed with negative effects

Magical armor is not normally available for purchase and must be found during adventures or awarded by the DM.
