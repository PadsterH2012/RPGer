## Mount and Vehicle Descriptions

### Land Mounts

**Camel**: Adapted for desert travel, camels can go up to a week with minimal water. They are stubborn but can carry heavy loads through harsh terrain.

**Dog, War**: Large, trained fighting dogs that can be used as mounts by small creatures like halflings and gnomes. They are loyal and fierce in combat.

**Horse, Draft**: Heavy horses bred for pulling wagons, plows, and other heavy loads. Not suitable for combat or fast travel.

**Horse, Heavy War**: Massive, powerful horses trained for battle. They can carry heavily armored knights and are trained not to panic in combat.

**Horse, Light War**: Faster and more agile than heavy war horses, these mounts balance speed with combat training. Preferred by scouts and light cavalry.

**Horse, Medium**: General purpose riding horses with moderate speed and carrying capacity. Common throughout civilized lands.

**Horse, Riding**: Bred for speed and endurance rather than carrying capacity. Ideal for messengers and travelers who value speed.

**Mule**: Hybrid offspring of a male donkey and female horse. Known for sure-footedness in rough terrain and stubborn but reliable temperament. Can carry heavy loads but are not suitable as war mounts.

**Ox**: Slow but powerful draft animals used primarily for pulling heavy wagons or plows. Not suitable as riding animals.

**Pony**: Smaller equines suitable as mounts for halflings, gnomes, and dwarves. More sure-footed than horses in mountainous terrain.

### Land Vehicles

**Cart**: Two-wheeled vehicles pulled by a single horse, mule, or ox. Used for transporting goods or people over short distances.

**Chariot**: Two-wheeled combat vehicles pulled by one or more horses. Light chariots prioritize speed, while heavy chariots sacrifice speed for stability and protection.

**Coach**: Enclosed four-wheeled vehicles pulled by multiple horses, providing comfortable transportation for passengers. Often used by nobility or wealthy merchants.

**Wagon**: Four-wheeled vehicles designed for transporting heavy loads over long distances. Typically pulled by multiple draft horses or oxen.

### Water Vessels

**Boat, River**: Flat-bottomed vessels designed for travel on rivers and lakes. Usually propelled by poles or oars, sometimes with a small sail.

**Boat, Sailing**: Small vessels with a single mast and sail, suitable for coastal waters and large lakes.

**Canoe**: Narrow, lightweight vessels propelled by paddles. Ideal for navigating rivers and shallow waters.

**Galley**: Large vessels propelled primarily by oars, with supplementary sails. War galleys are equipped with rams and fighting platforms.

**Longship**: Narrow, fast vessels with both oars and sails. Designed for both river and ocean travel, they have a shallow draft allowing them to navigate rivers and beach directly on shorelines.

**Sailing Ship**: Ocean-going vessels propelled by multiple sails. Merchant ships are designed for cargo capacity, while war ships carry weapons and troops.

### Mount Care and Maintenance

| Item                | Daily Cost (gp) | Notes                           |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Feed and water      | 5/10            | Double in barren or urban areas  |

Mounts require proper care to maintain their effectiveness:
- Daily feeding and watering
- Regular rest (8 hours per day)
- Cannot be pushed beyond normal movement rates for extended periods
- Require special care in extreme environments

### Vehicle Maintenance

| Maintenance Task    | Cost (gp)       | Frequency                       |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Wheel repair        | 5 to 15         | As needed                        |

| Sail repair         | 5 per 100 sq ft | As needed                        |
| General maintenance | 5% of value     | Annually                         |

Vehicles require regular maintenance to remain serviceable:
- Wheels and axles need regular inspection and occasional replacement
- Ships require hull maintenance to prevent leaks
- Sails and rigging must be repaired or replaced when damaged
- All vehicles should be protected from extreme weather when possible

## Hiring Transportation

When purchasing transportation is impractical, hiring is an alternative:

## Special Transportation Considerations

### Racial Preferences
- **Dwarves**: Prefer ponies as mounts due to their size and stability in mountainous terrain
- **Elves**: Often ride without saddles and prefer light horses without barding
- **Halflings**: Use ponies or large dogs as mounts
- **Gnomes**: Similar to halflings, prefer ponies or large dogs
- **Half-orcs**: Often choose the largest, strongest mounts available

### Class Considerations
- **Fighters**: May need mounts capable of carrying heavy armor and equipment
- **Paladins**: Special warhorse companion at higher levels
- **Rangers**: Skilled at handling animals in wilderness environments
- **Magic-Users**: Limited by encumbrance restrictions when flying
- **Clerics**: Often choose mounts appropriate to their deity
- **Thieves**: May prefer faster, quieter mounts for quick escapes
