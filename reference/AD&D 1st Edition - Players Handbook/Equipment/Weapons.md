Using a weapon without proficiency incurs the penalty shown to attack rolls.

## Weapon vs. Armor Type

The effectiveness of weapons varies based on the armor worn by opponents. The Dungeon Master may use optional tables that modify attack rolls based on the specific weapon used against specific armor types.

## Weapon Speed Factors

Each weapon has a speed factor that determines initiative in combat:

- Lower numbers indicate faster weapons
- Speed factors range from 1 (fastest) to 10 (slowest)
- Speed factors are used to break initiative ties
- Some DMs may apply additional modifiers based on weapon speed

## Weapon Space Required

The space required indicates how much room a character needs to effectively use the weapon:

- Confined spaces may limit weapon choices
- Longer weapons typically require more space
- Some weapons cannot be used in narrow corridors or small rooms
