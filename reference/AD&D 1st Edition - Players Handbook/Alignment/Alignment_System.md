# Alignment System

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Overview

Alignment in AD&D represents a character's basic attitude toward society and the cosmos. It is a combination of two factors: ethical perspective (lawful, neutral, or chaotic) and moral perspective (good, neutral, or evil). These two axes combine to form nine distinct alignments that guide a character's behavior and worldview.

Alignment is not merely a philosophical choice but a cosmic force in the AD&D multiverse. Certain spells, magic items, and supernatural beings interact with characters differently based on alignment. Some classes have alignment restrictions, and acting contrary to one's alignment can result in penalties or even class ability loss.

## The Nine Alignments

For detailed information on all nine alignments, including behavior guidelines, class restrictions, racial tendencies, and planar associations, see the [Alignment Tables](../Tables/Alignment_Tables.md).

## Alignment Languages

Each alignment has its own secret language that can be spoken only by creatures of that alignment. These languages consist of gestures, expressions, and certain code words that convey meaning beyond their apparent significance.

- Characters automatically know their alignment language
- Alignment languages cannot be written down
- Alignment languages cannot be learned by characters of different alignments
- Speaking in an alignment language in front of others is considered rude
- Alignment languages are used to identify like-minded individuals

For more information on alignment languages and how they interact with other languages, see the [Language Tables](../Tables/Language_Tables.md#alignment-languages).

## Alignment Restrictions

### Class Restrictions

While individuals may vary, races tend toward certain alignments:
- **Dwarves**: Usually Lawful Good or Lawful Neutral

## Changing Alignment

A character's alignment can change during play, either through deliberate choice or as a consequence of actions:

1. **Voluntary Change**: A character may decide to change alignment, but this is a serious matter with significant consequences:
   - Loss of experience points (typically one level's worth)
   - Possible loss of class abilities
   - Period of adjustment (typically 1-4 weeks of game time)
   - Rejection by former alignment-based organizations

2. **Involuntary Change**: Caused by:
   - Magical effects (certain spells, cursed items)
   - Prolonged behavior contrary to alignment
   - Divine intervention

The DM determines when a character's actions are inconsistent with their stated alignment and may impose an alignment change if behavior consistently contradicts the character's claimed ethical and moral stance.

## Alignment in the Multiverse

Alignment is a fundamental force in the AD&D multiverse:

- **The Planes**: Many outer planes correspond to specific alignments
- **Supernatural Beings**: Creatures like angels, demons, and devils embody specific alignments
- **Magic**: Many spells and magic items function differently based on alignment
- **Divine Powers**: Deities often require followers of specific alignments

## Alignment and Roleplaying

Alignment should guide character behavior without becoming a straitjacket:

- Use alignment as a guideline for decision-making
- Consider how your character's ethical and moral perspectives influence their choices
- Remember that few people are absolutely consistent in their behavior
- Allow for character growth and moral complexity
- Discuss alignment interpretations with your DM to ensure shared understanding

## Detecting Alignment

Several magical means exist to determine alignment:
- **Know Alignment** spell (2nd level Cleric spell)
- **Detect Evil/Detect Good** spells
- Certain magic items
- Some monsters have innate alignment detection abilities

Characters cannot determine alignment through normal observation, though consistent behavior may suggest a character's ethical and moral stance.

## Concealing Alignment

Alignment can be concealed through various means:
- **Undetectable Alignment** spell (2nd level Magic-User spell)
- Certain magic items
- Mind Blank and similar protections

## Practical Considerations

When selecting an alignment, consider:
- Compatibility with your chosen class
- Compatibility with your adventuring party
- The campaign setting's cultural norms
- Your character's background and upbringing
- Your own roleplaying preferences
