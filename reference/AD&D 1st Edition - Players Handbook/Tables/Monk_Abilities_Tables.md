## Monk Saving Throws

Monks use a unique saving throw table. See the [Combat Tables](../Tables/Combat_Tables.md#monk-saving-throws) for details.

## Special Ability Descriptions

### Stunning Attack
The monk can stun an opponent for 1d6 rounds if the opponent fails a saving throw vs. paralyzation. This ability can only be used against humanoid opponents of approximately human size.

### Speak with Animals
The monk can communicate with animals as per the druid spell of the same name.

### Mental Discipline
At 4th level, monks become immune to ESP and similar mind-reading abilities.

### Slow Fall
The monk can fall a certain distance without taking damage by using nearby walls to slow their descent.

### Feign Death
The monk can enter a trance-like state identical to the magic-user spell of the same name.

### Speak with Plants
The monk can communicate with plants as per the druid spell of the same name.

### Mind Bar
The monk becomes immune to quest and geas spells, as well as telepathic psionic attacks.

### Quivering Palm
Once per week, the monk can set up fatal vibrations in an opponent's body. The monk must make a successful hit, and the victim must be of the same size or smaller than the monk. The victim can be slain at any time within a number of days equal to the monk's level, simply by the monk willing it.
