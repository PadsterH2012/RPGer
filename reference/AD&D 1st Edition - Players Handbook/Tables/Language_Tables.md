*Note: The DM may require Intelligence checks for complex communication in non-native languages.*

## Reading and Writing

Characters with Intelligence of 8 or higher can read and write all languages they speak, with these exceptions:

1. Thieves' Cant is not a written language (though thieves may use special symbols)
2. Druidic has a secret written form known only to druids
3. Alignment languages have limited written forms
4. Animal languages (avian, burrowing mammals) have no written form
5. Some monster languages have no written form

## Language Learning

Characters can learn new languages during gameplay through:

1. **Study**: 1 month of study per language under a tutor
2. **Immersion**: 3 months of constant exposure to the language
3. **Magic**: Spells like Comprehend Languages or Tongues
4. **Magic Items**: Certain magic items grant language abilities

*Note: Learning a new language during gameplay requires DM approval and may involve Intelligence checks.*
