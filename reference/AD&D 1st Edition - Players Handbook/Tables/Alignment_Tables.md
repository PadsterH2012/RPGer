| Chaotic Good     | Chaotic Good      |
| Chaotic Neutral  | Chaotic Neutral   |

1. **Experience Point Penalty**: Characters lose 10% to 25% of their experience points when changing alignment.
2. **Class Restrictions**: Characters whose class requires a specific alignment (e.g., Paladins, Druids) lose their class abilities until they atone or change class.
3. **Magical Effects**: Certain magic items may harm characters who change alignment.
4. **Divine Consequences**: Clerics who change alignment may lose their spell abilities until they atone or change deity.
