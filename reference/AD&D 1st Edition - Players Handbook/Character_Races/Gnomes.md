## Special Note on Gnomish Illusionists

Gnomes have a natural affinity for illusion magic, making them exceptional illusionists:

- They receive a +5% bonus to learn illusion spells
- They can cast certain illusion spells with enhanced effects (DM's discretion)
- Their natural resistance to magic does not apply to illusion spells they cast

This affinity is believed to stem from the gnomes' connection to the earth and their naturally creative minds. Many gnomish communities have at least one illusionist who uses their talents both for entertainment and protection.
