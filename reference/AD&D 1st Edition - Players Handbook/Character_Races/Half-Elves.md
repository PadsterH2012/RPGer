# Half-Elves

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Racial Overview

Half-elves are the offspring of human and elven parents, combining features of both races. They typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh between 130 and 170 pounds. Half-elves inherit the longevity of their elven parents, though not to the same extent, living for about 250 years. They possess some of the natural abilities of elves while sharing the adaptability of humans, making them versatile adventurers.

## Special Note on Half-Elven Identity

Half-elves often struggle with questions of identity and belonging. They mature at a rate closer to humans but live much longer, often outliving their human friends and family. Yet they age and die while their elven relations remain virtually unchanged. This unique perspective can make half-elves particularly thoughtful and empathetic, but can also lead to a sense of isolation.

Many half-elves respond to this challenge in one of several ways:
- Embracing their unique status as bridges between two worlds
- Choosing to identify more strongly with one parent culture
- Seeking out other half-elves to form their own communities
- Becoming wanderers or adventurers, never fully settling in any one place

## Half-Elves and Multi-classing

Half-elves excel at multi-classing due to their diverse heritage. When creating a multi-classed half-elf:

1. **Experience Division**: Experience points are divided equally among all classes
2. **Hit Points**: Calculate hit points for each class separately, then average them
3. **Combat Abilities**: Use the most favorable combat table
4. **Saving Throws**: Use the most favorable saving throw for each category
5. **Abilities**: Gain all abilities of each class with some restrictions
6. **Armor**: Must adhere to the most restrictive armor limitations
7. **Weapons**: Can use weapons from any of their classes

Popular multi-class combinations include:
- **Fighter/Magic-User**: Combines combat prowess with arcane spellcasting
- **Fighter/Thief**: Blends combat ability with stealth and special skills
- **Cleric/Ranger**: Merges divine magic with wilderness skills
- **Fighter/Magic-User/Thief**: Ultimate versatility at the cost of slower advancement

## Half-Elves and Bards

Half-elves can become bards through a special progression:
1. Begin as a Fighter
2. Switch to Thief after reaching at least 5th level as a Fighter
3. Switch to Druid after reaching at least 5th level as a Thief
4. Character becomes a 1st level Bard, retaining some abilities from previous classes

This complex progression makes bards rare, but half-elves are particularly well-suited to this path due to their versatility and longevity.

## Regional Variations

Half-elves may vary depending on the elven subrace of their parent:

### High Elven Heritage
- Most common type of half-elf
- Typically more refined and attuned to magic
- Often have silver or golden hair

### Wood Elven Heritage
- More attuned to nature
- May have slightly better wilderness skills
- Often have brown or auburn hair

### Other Heritages
- Rare half-elves with drow, aquatic, or other exotic elven heritage exist
- These may have different abilities or characteristics
- Such variants are typically handled by the DM on a case-by-case basis
