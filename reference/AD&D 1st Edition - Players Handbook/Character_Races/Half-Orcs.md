# Half-Orcs

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Racial Overview

Half-orcs are the offspring of human and orc parents, combining the worst physical features of both races but possessing greater mental capabilities than their orcish parents. They typically stand between 5½ and 6½ feet tall and weigh between 150 and 230 pounds. Half-orcs are known for their strength, endurance, and natural aptitude for certain unsavory professions. They have a lifespan similar to humans, though slightly shorter, living approximately 60 years.

## Special Note on Half-Orc Identity

Half-orcs often struggle with questions of identity and belonging. Rejected by both parent races in many cases, they must forge their own path in a world that views them with suspicion and hostility. This unique perspective can make half-orcs particularly determined and self-reliant, but can also lead to bitterness and antisocial behavior.

Many half-orcs respond to this challenge in one of several ways:
- Embracing their orcish heritage and living among orcs
- Attempting to integrate into human society by suppressing orcish traits
- Forming communities with other half-orcs and outcasts
- Becoming loners who avoid settled areas entirely

## Half-Orcs and Multi-classing

Half-orcs excel at certain multi-class combinations due to their physical prowess. When creating a multi-classed half-orc:

1. **Experience Division**: Experience points are divided equally among all classes
2. **Hit Points**: Calculate hit points for each class separately, then average them
3. **Combat Abilities**: Use the most favorable combat table
4. **Saving Throws**: Use the most favorable saving throw for each category
5. **Abilities**: Gain all abilities of each class with some restrictions
6. **Armor**: Must adhere to the most restrictive armor limitations
7. **Weapons**: Can use weapons from any of their classes

Popular multi-class combinations include:
- **Fighter/Thief**: Combines combat prowess with stealth and special skills
- **Fighter/Assassin**: Deadly combination of fighting ability and assassination skills
- **Cleric/Assassin**: Unusual but effective combination of divine magic and deadly skills

## Half-Orcs and Assassins

Half-orcs have a natural aptitude for the assassin class, able to advance to 15th level (higher than any other non-human race). This is attributed to their combination of physical strength, natural stealth, and somewhat detached moral perspective. Half-orc assassins are particularly feared for their effectiveness and ruthlessness.

- Pragmatic architecture focused on function over form
