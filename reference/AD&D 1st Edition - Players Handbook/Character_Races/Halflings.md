## Special Note on Halfling Communities

Halfling settlements are typically small, peaceful villages with well-tended gardens and comfortable homes. Many halflings live in burrows dug into hillsides, with round doors and windows. These communities are often overlooked by larger races, which suits the halflings fine. They maintain excellent relations with nearby human settlements, often trading agricultural goods and crafts.

Despite their peaceful nature, halfling communities can defend themselves when necessary. They are skilled with slings and thrown weapons, and their natural stealth makes them effective at ambushes and guerrilla tactics when their homes are threatened.
