# Introduction to AD&D

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## What is Advanced Dungeons & Dragons?

Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) is a fantasy role-playing game that allows players to create characters who embark on imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. The game is conducted through a combination of storytelling, dice rolling, and tactical decision-making. One player takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), who serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while the other players each create and control a player character (PC).

## Core Concepts

### The Role-Playing Game

AD&D is fundamentally a game of imagination and creativity. Unlike board games with rigid rules and victory conditions, role-playing games offer:

- **Open-ended play**: No predetermined ending or "winning" condition
- **Collaborative storytelling**: Players and DM create the narrative together
- **Character development**: PCs grow and change over time
- **Problem-solving**: Challenges can be overcome through various approaches
- **Social interaction**: Players interact with each other and with the DM's non-player characters (NPCs)

### The Dungeon Master

The Dungeon Master has several crucial responsibilities:

- **World-building**: Creating the fantasy setting and its inhabitants
- **Adventure design**: Crafting scenarios, dungeons, and challenges
- **Rules adjudication**: Interpreting and applying the game rules
- **NPC portrayal**: Role-playing all characters not controlled by players
- **Narration**: Describing environments, events, and outcomes
- **Impartiality**: Serving as a fair referee, not an adversary

### Player Characters

Each player creates and controls a character with:

- **Race**: The character's species (human, elf, dwarf, etc.)
- **Class**: The character's profession or vocation (fighter, magic-user, cleric, etc.)
- **Abilities**: Six core attributes that define physical and mental capabilities
- **Skills and powers**: Special abilities based on class and experience
- **Equipment**: Weapons, armor, and tools for adventuring
- **Personality**: Motivations, beliefs, and behavioral traits

### Game Mechanics

AD&D uses various mechanics to resolve actions and determine outcomes:

- **Dice rolling**: Polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100) determine random results
- **Ability checks**: Tests against character attributes to determine success
- **Combat system**: Structured rules for resolving conflicts and battles
- **Saving throws**: Resistance checks against various dangers
- **Experience points**: Rewards that allow characters to advance in level
- **Tables and charts**: References for resolving specific situations
