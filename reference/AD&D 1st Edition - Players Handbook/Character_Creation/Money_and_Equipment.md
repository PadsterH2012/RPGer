# Money and Equipment

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Currency System

The AD&D world uses a standardized currency system based on precious metals:

### Standard Coins

| Coin Type        | Abbreviation | Metal      | Value          | Weight |
|------------------|--------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| Copper Piece     | cp           | Copper     | 1/100 gp       | 1/10 lb|
| Silver Piece     | sp           | Silver     | 1/10 gp        | 1/10 lb|
| Electrum Piece   | ep           | Electrum   | 1/2 gp         | 1/10 lb|
| Gold Piece       | gp           | Gold       | 1 gp (standard)| 1/10 lb|
| Platinum Piece   | pp           | Platinum   | 5 gp           | 1/10 lb|

### Currency Conversion

| Have       | cp    | sp   | ep   | gp   | pp   |
|------------|-------|------|------|------|------|
| 1 cp =     | 1     | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100| 1/500|
| 1 sp =     | 10    | 1    | 1/5  | 1/10 | 1/50 |
| 1 ep =     | 50    | 5    | 1    | 1/2  | 1/10 |
| 1 gp =     | 100   | 10   | 2    | 1    | 1/5  |
| 1 pp =     | 500   | 50   | 10   | 5    | 1    |

### Encumbrance

Coins contribute to a character's encumbrance:
- 10 coins = 1 pound
- 100 coins = 1 gp weight (encumbrance unit)
- Characters typically carry coins in pouches, purses, or chests

## Starting Money

New characters begin with a random amount of gold pieces based on their class:

| Character Class | Starting Money (in gold pieces) |

| Cleric          | 3d6 × 10 (30-180 gp)           |
