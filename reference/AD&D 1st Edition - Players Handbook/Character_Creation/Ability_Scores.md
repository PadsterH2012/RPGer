# Ability Scores

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Overview

The first step in creating an AD&D character is determining the character's ability scores. These six abilities form the foundation of every character and influence many aspects of gameplay.

The six ability scores are:

1. **Strength (STR)**: Physical power and muscle
2. **Intelligence (INT)**: Learning ability and reasoning
3. **Wisdom (WIS)**: Willpower and common sense
4. **Dexterity (DEX)**: Agility, reflexes, and hand-eye coordination
5. **Constitution (CON)**: Health, stamina, and vital force
6. **Charisma (CHA)**: Leadership, persuasiveness, and personal magnetism

## Generating Ability Scores

The Dungeon Master will specify which method to use for generating ability scores. The four standard methods are:

### Method I
Roll 3d6 for each ability in order (STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON, CHA). This method produces characters with a range of strengths and weaknesses.

### Method II
Roll 3d6 twelve times and record the results. The player then assigns the highest six rolls to the abilities as desired. This method allows for some customization while maintaining balance.

### Method III
Roll 3d6 six times for each ability and record the highest roll for each. This method tends to produce above-average characters.

### Method IV
Roll 4d6, discard the lowest die, and total the remaining three dice. Do this six times and assign the totals to abilities as desired. This method produces characters with generally higher abilities.

## Ability Score Ranges

The normal range for human ability scores is 3-18, with 3 being the minimum and 18 being the maximum. Some demi-human races have different ranges for certain abilities.

The average score is 10-11, representing typical human capability. Scores of 15 or higher are considered exceptional, while scores below 6 represent significant deficiencies.

## Ability Score Requirements

Each character class has minimum ability score requirements that must be met to qualify for that class. These requirements ensure that characters have the necessary aptitudes for their chosen profession.

For example:
- Fighters require a minimum Strength of 9
- Magic-Users require a minimum Intelligence of 9
- Clerics require a minimum Wisdom of 9
- Thieves require a minimum Dexterity of 9

Some classes have multiple ability requirements. For instance, a Paladin must have a minimum Strength of 12, Intelligence of 9, Wisdom of 13, Constitution of 9, and Charisma of 17.

## Ability Score Adjustments

Certain races receive adjustments to their ability scores:

- **Dwarves**: +1 Constitution, -1 Charisma
- **Elves**: +1 Dexterity, -1 Constitution
- **Gnomes**: No adjustments
- **Half-Elves**: No adjustments
- **Halflings**: +1 Dexterity, -1 Strength
- **Half-Orcs**: +1 Strength, +1 Constitution, -2 Charisma
- **Humans**: No adjustments

These adjustments are applied after the initial ability scores are determined.

## Exceptional Strength

Fighter-type characters (Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers) with a Strength of 18 may roll percentile dice (d100) to determine exceptional strength. This additional roll results in a score of 18/01 to 18/00, with higher percentiles indicating greater strength.

Exceptional Strength provides bonuses to hit, damage, weight allowance, and other strength-related activities.

## Changing Ability Scores

Once generated, ability scores generally remain fixed throughout a character's career. However, certain magical items and spells can temporarily or permanently alter ability scores.

Additionally, human characters may choose to become dual-classed, which may require them to meet new ability score requirements for their second class.
