# Magic System

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Overview

Magic in AD&D is a complex system of supernatural forces that spellcasting characters can manipulate through specific procedures. The magic system divides spells into two broad categories: arcane magic (used by magic-users and illusionists) and divine magic (used by clerics and druids). Each type of magic functions differently in terms of acquisition, preparation, and casting.

## Types of Magic

### Arcane Magic
- **Practitioners**: Magic-users and Illusionists
- **Source**: Study, memorization, and manipulation of magical energies
- **Acquisition**: Spells must be recorded in spellbooks and learned individually
- **Limitations**: Requires verbal, somatic, and material components
- **Restrictions**: Cannot be cast while wearing armor (except elfin chain mail)

### Divine Magic
- **Practitioners**: Clerics and Druids
- **Source**: Granted by deities or natural forces
- **Acquisition**: Access to all spells of appropriate level
- **Limitations**: Requires verbal and somatic components, sometimes material
- **Restrictions**: Must maintain good standing with deity or power source

## Spell Characteristics

Each spell has several defining characteristics:

### Level
- Indicates the spell's power and complexity
- Determines when a caster can access the spell
- Ranges from 1st (least powerful) to 9th (most powerful)

### Components
- **Verbal (V)**: Spoken words or sounds
- **Somatic (S)**: Precise hand and body movements
- **Material (M)**: Physical substances or objects

### Casting Time
- Measured in segments (10 segments = 1 round)
- Affects when the spell takes effect in combat
- Longer casting times increase vulnerability during casting

### Range
- Distance at which the spell can be targeted
- May be touch, line of sight, or specific distance
- Some spells only affect the caster

### Duration
- How long the spell's effects last
- May be instantaneous, rounds, turns, hours, or permanent
- Some spells can be dismissed by the caster

### Area of Effect
- The space or targets affected by the spell
- May be a single target, area, or volume
- Some spells can be shaped by the caster

### Saving Throw
- Determines if targets can resist or reduce the spell's effects
- Different spells allow different types of saving throws
- Success may negate the effect or reduce damage

## Spell Preparation and Casting

### Arcane Spellcasting

## Magical Energy and the Multiverse

### The Planes and Magic

## Detecting and Dispelling Magic

### Detection

### Dispelling
- Dispel Magic removes or suppresses magical effects
- Higher-level casters are more effective at dispelling
- Some magic is too powerful to be easily dispelled
