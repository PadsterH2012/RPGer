## Spell Descriptions

### Affect Normal Fires

**Level:** 1  
**Components:** V, S, M  
**Range:** 5 feet/level  
**Duration:** 1 round/level  
**Casting Time:** 1 segment  
**Saving Throw:** None  
**Area of Effect:** 1' radius/level  

This spell enables the magic-user to cause non-magical fires - from as small as a torch or lantern to as large as a bonfire - to reduce in size and brightness to become mere coals or increase in light to become as bright as full daylight and increase the illumination to double the normal radius. Note that this spell does not affect either fuel consumption or damage potential of a fire. The caster can affect any fire within the area of effect. The spell lasts for 1 round for each level of experience of the caster.

The material component of the spell is a bit of tallow or a small twist of waxed string.

### Burning Hands

**Level:** 1  
**Components:** V, S  
**Range:** 0  
**Duration:** Instantaneous  
**Casting Time:** 1 segment  
**Saving Throw:** None  
**Area of Effect:** Special  

When the magic-user casts this spell, jets of searing flame shoot from the fingertips. The spell causes 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, i.e. a 2nd level magic-user would do 2 points of damage, a 3rd level magic-user would do 3 points of damage, etc. The flames shoot to a distance of 3" in a cone 120° in arc. Any creature in the area of flames must suffer full damage unless it makes a saving throw versus the spell, in which case it takes no damage.

### Charm Person

**Level:** 1  
**Components:** V, S  
**Range:** 12"  
**Duration:** Special  
**Casting Time:** 1 segment  
**Saving Throw:** Negates  
**Area of Effect:** One person  

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not.

The person receives a saving throw versus magic to avoid the effect, with any adjustment due to wisdom (see Wisdom Table II, page 11). If the person receives damage from the caster's party in the same round the charm is cast, an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of damage received will be added to the victim's saving throw.

If the spell recipient fails his or her saving throw, he or she regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed person as if he or she were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster will be viewed in the most favorable way. Thus, a charmed person would not obey a suicide command, but he or she might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the person to hold back an onrushing red dragon for "just a round or two." Note also that the spell does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those he or she normally possesses.

The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person's intelligence and is tied to the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a successful saving throw is rolled, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's intelligence:

| Intelligence Score | Time Between Checks |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| 3 or less          | 3 months            |
| 4-6                | 2 months            |
| 7-9                | 1 month             |
| 10-12              | 3 weeks             |
| 13-14              | 2 weeks             |
| 15-16              | 1 week              |
| 17                 | 3 days              |
| 18                 | 2 days              |
| 19 or more         | 1 day               |

If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.

If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being torn by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells.

Note that the subject will be hostile when the charm effect ends if the charmer has behaved in a manner which would cause hostility under normal circumstances.

### Comprehend Languages

**Level:** 1  
**Components:** V, S, M  
**Range:** 0  
**Duration:** 5 rounds/level  
**Casting Time:** 1 round  
**Saving Throw:** None  
**Area of Effect:** One written object or speaking creature  

When this spell is cast, the magic-user is able to understand the spoken words of a creature or read an otherwise incomprehensible written message, such as writing in another language. In either case, the caster must touch the creature or the writing. Note that the ability to read does not necessarily impart understanding of the material, nor does the spell enable the caster to speak or write an unknown language. Written material can be read at the rate of 1 page (250 words) per round. Magical writing cannot be read, other than to know it is magical, but the spell is often useful when deciphering treasure maps. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the secret page and illusory script spells), and it does not reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.

The material components of this spell are a pinch of soot and a few grains of salt.

### Dancing Lights

**Level:** 1  
**Components:** V, S, M  
**Range:** 4" + 1"/level  
**Duration:** 2 rounds/level  
**Casting Time:** 1 segment  
**Saving Throw:** None  
**Area of Effect:** Special  

When a dancing lights spell is cast, the magic-user creates, at his or her option, from 1 to 4 lights which resemble either torches or lanterns (and cast light in a 15' radius), glowing spheres (which look like will-o-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely man-like shape, somewhat similar to that of a creature from the Elemental Plane of Fire. The dancing lights move as the spellcaster desires, forward or back, straight or turning corners, without concentration upon such movement by the magic-user. The spell cannot be used to cause blindness (cf. light spell), and it winks out if the range or duration is exceeded.

The material component of this spell is either a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm.

### Detect Magic

**Level:** 1  
**Components:** V, S  
**Range:** 0  
**Duration:** 2 rounds/level  
**Casting Time:** 1 segment  
**Saving Throw:** None  
**Area of Effect:** 1" path, 6" long  

When the detect magic spell is cast, the magic-user detects magical radiations in a path 1" wide and 6" long, in the direction he or she is facing. The caster can turn 60° per round. Note that stone walls of 1' or more thickness, solid metal of a thin layer of lead will block the spell.

The spell will detect magical radiations from:
- Magic items
- Spells in effect
- Enchanted monsters
- Magical places, areas, or terrain features

The caster has a 10% chance per level to determine the type of magic (alteration, conjuration, etc.) present. The caster cannot detect magic on himself or his own belongings.
