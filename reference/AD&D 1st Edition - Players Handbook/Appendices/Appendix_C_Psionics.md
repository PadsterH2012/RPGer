## Psionic Combat Procedure

1. **Initiative**: Roll 1d6 for each combatant. Higher roll wins initiative.
2. **Attack Mode Selection**: Each combatant secretly selects an attack mode.
3. **Defense Mode Selection**: Each combatant secretly selects a defense mode.
4. **PSP Expenditure**: Subtract the PSP cost of the selected modes from each combatant's PSP total.
5. **Attack Resolution**: Consult the Attack/Defense Mode Interaction Table to determine if the attack succeeds.
6. **Damage Calculation**: If an attack succeeds, the defender loses PSPs equal to the attacker's roll on the following table:

| Attack Mode        | Damage Dice |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Psionic Blast      | 1d10        |
| Mind Thrust        | 2d6         |
| Ego Whip           | 3d6         |
| Id Insinuation     | 4d6         |
| Psychic Crush      | 5d6         |

7. **Special Effects**: If a psionic attack reduces a defender to 0 PSPs, additional effects occur based on the attack mode used.
