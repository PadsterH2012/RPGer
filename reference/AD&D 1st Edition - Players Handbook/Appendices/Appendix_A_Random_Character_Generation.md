# Appendix A: Random Character Generation

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

This appendix provides tables and procedures for randomly generating player characters, including ability scores, race, class, alignment, and other characteristics.

## Method I: Ability Score Generation

Roll 4d6, discard the lowest die, and total the remaining three dice. Do this six times and assign the totals to the six ability scores as desired.

## Method II: Ability Score Generation

Roll 3d6 twelve times, recording each roll. Choose the six highest rolls and assign them to ability scores as desired.

## Method III: Ability Score Generation

Roll 3d6 six times for each ability score in order (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma). The player may then choose to play any class for which the character qualifies.

## Method IV: Ability Score Generation

Roll 3d6 six times and assign to ability scores as desired. If the character qualifies for the class the player wants, the character is ready to play. If not, the player may add 2 points to one ability score and subtract 1 point from two other ability scores to qualify.
