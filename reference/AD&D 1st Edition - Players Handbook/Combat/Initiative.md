# Initiative

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Overview

Initiative in AD&D determines the order in which combatants act during a round. The initiative system ensures that combat proceeds in an orderly fashion, with actions resolved in a logical sequence. While the basic initiative system is straightforward, various factors can modify initiative, creating a dynamic and tactical combat experience.

## Basic Initiative System

### Group Initiative

The standard initiative system in AD&D is group-based:

1. Each side rolls 1d6 at the beginning of each round
2. The side with the higher roll acts first
3. The side with the lower roll acts second
4. In case of a tie, actions occur simultaneously

This system treats each side (players vs. monsters) as a group, with all members of the group acting in the same initiative phase.

### Individual Initiative (Optional Rule)

For more detailed combat, the DM may use individual initiative:

1. Each combatant rolls 1d6, modified by Dexterity and other factors
2. Combatants act in order from highest to lowest initiative
3. Ties result in simultaneous actions

This system creates more varied and unpredictable combat but requires more tracking by the DM.

## Initiative Modifiers

Various factors can modify initiative rolls:

### Dexterity Modifiers

| Dexterity | Initiative Modifier |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 3         | -3                  |
| 4-5       | -2                  |
| 6-8       | -1                  |
| 9-12      | 0                   |
| 13-15     | +1                  |
| 16-17     | +2                  |
| 18        | +3                  |
| 19+       | +4                  |

### Weapon Speed Factors

Each weapon has a speed factor that can affect initiative:

1. When initiative is tied, the combatant with the faster weapon (lower speed factor) strikes first
2. In some cases, a significantly faster weapon may grant a bonus to initiative

Typical weapon speed factors:
- Dagger: 2
- Short sword: 3
- Long sword: 5
- Two-handed sword: 10
- Mace: 7
- Battle axe: 7
- Spear: 6

### Spell Casting Time

Spells have casting times that determine when they take effect:

1. Spells with shorter casting times are completed earlier in the round
2. Casting time is measured in segments (10 segments = 1 round)
3. A spell takes effect when its casting time is complete

For example:
- A spell with a casting time of 1 takes effect almost immediately
- A spell with a casting time of 9 takes effect near the end of the round

### Creature Size and Speed

Some creatures have natural initiative modifiers:
- Very small or quick creatures may gain a bonus
- Large or slow creatures may suffer a penalty
- These modifiers are typically noted in the creature's description

### Situational Modifiers

The DM may assign situational modifiers based on circumstances:
- Higher ground: +1
- Prepared action: +1
- Surprised: Cannot act during surprise rounds
- Hindered movement: -1 to -3
- Darkness or difficult terrain: -1 to -2

## Initiative Sequence

Once initiative is determined, actions are resolved in the following sequence:

### 1. Spells and Magical Effects
- Spells take effect in order of casting time
- Magical item activations occur
- Innate magical abilities are used

### 2. Missile Weapons
- Thrown weapons and projectiles are resolved
- Includes bows, crossbows, slings, and thrown weapons
- Range and cover modifiers apply

### 3. Movement
- Characters and creatures move
- Movement can be split before and after melee
- Charging, retreating, and other special movements occur

### 4. Melee Combat
- Hand-to-hand combat is resolved
- Multiple attacks (for high-level fighters, etc.) are resolved
- Special combat maneuvers are executed

## Special Initiative Situations

### Surprise

When surprise occurs, special initiative rules apply:
- Surprised combatants lose 1-2 segments of action
- Non-surprised combatants can act during these surprise segments
- After surprise segments, normal initiative begins

### Held Actions

Characters can choose to hold their action:
- The character delays until a specific trigger occurs
- When the trigger occurs, the held action is resolved immediately
- If the trigger doesn't occur, the action may be lost

### Interrupted Spellcasting

Spellcasting can be interrupted:
- If a spellcaster takes damage before the spell is complete, the spell fails
- The spell slot is lost
- Some spells with very short casting times may be difficult to interrupt

### Withdrawing from Combat

Special initiative rules apply when withdrawing:
- Fighting withdrawal: Move at half speed while maintaining defense
- Full retreat: Move at full speed but provoke free attacks

## Segmented Initiative System (Optional)

For highly detailed combat, the DM may use a segmented system:

1. The round is divided into 10 segments
2. Each action occurs on a specific segment based on initiative and modifiers
3. Faster weapons and spells occur on earlier segments
4. Movement is divided across segments

This system provides the most tactical detail but requires significant tracking.

## Initiative and Multiple Attacks

Some characters and creatures can make multiple attacks per round:

### Fighters and Ranger Progression
- Levels 1-6: 1 attack per round
- Levels 7-12: 3 attacks per 2 rounds
- Levels 13+: 2 attacks per round

### Monks Progression
- Levels 1-2: 1 attack per round
- Levels 3-6: 3 attacks per 2 rounds
- Levels 7-10: 2 attacks per round
- Levels 11-14: 5 attacks per 2 rounds
- Levels 15+: 3 attacks per round

### Monsters with Multiple Attacks
- Attacks are typically resolved in the order listed in the monster description
- All attacks are resolved in the same initiative phase

## Initiative and Movement

Movement and attacks can be combined in various ways:

### Standard Movement
- Move up to full movement rate and attack
- Split movement before and after attack

### Charge
- Move up to 1.5Ã— normal movement rate
- +2 bonus to hit
- -2 penalty to AC
- Must move at least 10 feet
- Must attack at the end of movement

### Fighting Withdrawal
- Move at half speed
- No penalty to defense
- No opportunity attacks from engaged opponents

### Full Retreat
- Move at full speed
- Opponents get a free attack at +2 to hit
- No return attacks allowed

## Practical Initiative Examples

### Example 1: Basic Group Initiative
1. Party of adventurers encounters a group of orcs
2. Players roll 4 for initiative, orcs roll 2
3. Players act first (higher roll wins)
4. All player characters complete their actions
5. Orcs act second, completing their actions
6. Round ends, new initiative is rolled

### Example 2: Tied Initiative with Weapon Factors
1. Fighter with long sword (speed factor 5) and orc with battle axe (speed factor 7) tie initiative
2. Fighter attacks first due to faster weapon
3. If both had the same weapon speed, attacks would be simultaneous

### Example 3: Spellcasting and Initiative
1. Magic-user begins casting Fireball (casting time 3)
2. Initiative determines when in the round casting begins
3. Spell takes effect 3 segments after casting begins
4. If the magic-user takes damage before segment 3 is complete, the spell fails

## Initiative and Tactical Considerations

### Positioning
- Initiative can determine who reaches a strategic position first
- Higher initiative allows setting up advantageous positions

### Spellcasting
- Spellcasters should consider casting time when selecting spells
- Faster spells are less likely to be interrupted

### Weapon Selection
- Faster weapons may provide advantages in tied initiative situations
- Consider having both fast and powerful weapons available

### Surprise
- Maximizing surprise potential can grant free actions
- Stealth and ambush tactics can create significant advantages

## House Rules and Variations

The DM may implement various initiative house rules:

### Declared Actions
- Actions must be declared before initiative is rolled
- Initiative determines the order of resolution
- Changes to declared actions may incur penalties

### Initiative Reroll
- Initiative may be rerolled each round or maintained for multiple rounds
- Maintaining initiative reduces tracking but creates less dynamic combat

### Mixed Systems
- Group initiative for minions and lesser foes
- Individual initiative for major characters and significant monsters
- Balances detail with playability
