# Special Combat Situations

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Surprise

Surprise occurs when combatants encounter each other unexpectedly, giving one side a momentary advantage.

### Determining Surprise

1. Each side rolls 1d6
2. A roll of 1 or 2 indicates surprise
3. If both sides are surprised, they effectively cancel out
4. If only one side is surprised, the non-surprised side gains 1-2 segments of free action

### Modifiers to Surprise

**Character Abilities:**
- Rangers are only surprised on a 1
- Monks have reduced chance of being surprised as they gain levels
- Characters with high Dexterity may reduce surprise segments

**Racial Abilities:**
- Elves, half-elves, and halflings have bonuses against surprise
- Halflings and elves surprise others more easily in certain environments

**Situational Factors:**
- Noise, light, or other warnings reduce surprise chances
- Careful preparation may grant bonuses
- Distraction increases surprise chances

### Effects of Surprise

- Surprised characters cannot act during surprise segments
- Non-surprised characters gain free actions during surprise segments
- Thieves can backstab during surprise rounds
- Spells with casting times shorter than the surprise period can be cast

## Charging

Charging is a special attack where a character rushes at an opponent to deliver a powerful blow.

### Charging Procedure

1. Declare charge at the beginning of the round
2. Must move at least 10 feet in a straight line
3. Can move up to double normal movement rate
4. Attack occurs at the end of the charge

### Charging Effects

- +2 bonus to attack roll
- -2 penalty to Armor Class during and after the charge
- Damage varies by weapon (some weapons do double damage)
- Set spears against a charge do double damage to the charger

### Mounted Charging

- Lance does double damage when used in a mounted charge
- Requires at least 20 feet of straight movement
- Mount must be trained for combat

## Weapon vs. Armor Type (Optional Rule)

Different weapons have varying effectiveness against different types of armor.

### Weapon Type Categories

- **Bludgeoning**: Mace, hammer, flail, staff
- **Piercing**: Spear, arrow, bolt, dagger
- **Slashing**: Sword, axe, scimitar
- **Pole Arms**: Halberd, glaive, pike

### Armor Type Categories

- **Unarmored**: AC 10
- **Leather/Padded**: AC 8
- **Studded/Ring**: AC 7
- **Scale**: AC 6
- **Chain**: AC 5
- **Banded/Splint**: AC 4
- **Plate**: AC 3

### Adjustment Table

The DM may use a table that provides modifiers to attack rolls based on weapon type vs. armor type. For example:
- Bludgeoning weapons are more effective against plate armor
- Piercing weapons are more effective against leather and chain
- Slashing weapons are more effective against unarmored opponents

## Grappling and Pummeling

2. Damage is 1-2 points (1d3-1)
3. Strength damage bonuses apply
4. May stun opponent on a natural 20

### Grappling (Wrestling)

1. Requires a successful hit roll
2. Followed by an opposed Strength check
3. Success allows holding, throwing, or immobilizing opponent
4. No direct damage, but can render opponent helpless

## Mounted Combat

Fighting from horseback provides several advantages and special considerations:

### Mounted Combat Advantages

- Height advantage (+1 to hit against unmounted opponents)
- Increased mobility and movement rate
- Charge attack with lance does double damage
- Can use mount's movement to disengage

### Mounted Combat Limitations

- Some weapons cannot be used effectively from horseback

## Underwater Combat

Combat beneath the surface of water has special restrictions:

### Weapon Restrictions

- Only thrusting weapons (dagger, spear, trident) can be used effectively
- All attacks suffer a -2 penalty
- Damage is reduced for most weapons

### Movement Restrictions

- Movement rates are typically reduced to 1/3 normal
- Heavily armored characters may sink
- Swimming requires constant movement

### Breathing Considerations

- Characters without water breathing magic must hold their breath
- Constitution determines how long breath can be held
- Exertion (such as combat) reduces this time

## Aerial Combat

Combat in the air (via flying mounts, levitation, etc.) has unique considerations:

### Movement in Three Dimensions

- Altitude becomes a tactical factor
- Diving attacks may gain bonuses
- Rising attacks may suffer penalties

### Falling Damage

- Falling or being knocked from flight causes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen
- Maximum damage is typically 20d6
- Magic may reduce or negate this damage

## Invisibility in Combat

Invisible attackers and defenders have special advantages and limitations:

### Attacking While Invisible

- +4 bonus to attack rolls
- Defender cannot use shield or Dexterity bonus to AC
- Location may be detected by sound, footprints, etc.

### Defending While Invisible

- Attackers suffer -4 penalty to hit
- Area effect spells may still affect invisible creatures
- Invisibility typically ends when the invisible creature attacks

## Darkness and Blindness

Combat in darkness or when blinded presents special challenges:

### Effects of Darkness

- -4 penalty to attack rolls in partial darkness

- Area of effect spells may still function normally

### Infravision and Ultravision

- Infravision allows seeing heat patterns in darkness
- Some creatures and races have natural infravision

## Cover and Concealment

### Cover

Physical protection that blocks attacks:
- 25% cover: -2 penalty to attack rolls

## Firing into Melee

Shooting missiles into a melee combat is risky:

3. Random determination of which combatant is hit
4. Some DMs apply penalties to the attack roll

### Risk Reduction

- Higher ground reduces risk
- Precise positioning can minimize risk
- Some magical items may help target specific combatants

## Called Shots

As an optional rule, characters may attempt to hit specific body parts or objects:

### Procedure

1. Declare the called shot before rolling
2. Apply penalty to attack roll (-2 to -8 depending on target size)
3. If successful, achieve the special effect (disarm, blind, etc.)
4. If unsuccessful, the attack misses completely

### Common Called Shots
