# Saving Throws

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Overview

Saving throws represent a character's chance to avoid or reduce the effects of various dangers, hazards, and magical attacks that cannot be dodged or blocked in normal combat. A successful saving throw might mean the character dodged a fireball, resisted the effects of a charm spell, or held their breath to avoid the full effects of a poison gas cloud.

## Saving Throw Categories

AD&D uses five categories of saving throws, each representing different types of threats:

### 1. Paralyzation, Poison, or Death Magic

This saving throw is used against:
- Poison of all types (contact, ingested, injected)
- Paralysis effects (ghoul touch, hold person)
- Death magic (finger of death, symbol of death)
- Other instant-kill effects

### 2. Rod, Staff, or Wand

This saving throw is used against:
- Magical effects from rods
- Magical effects from staves
- Magical effects from wands
- Some other magical devices

### 3. Petrification or Polymorph

This saving throw is used against:
- Petrification (medusa gaze, flesh to stone)
- Polymorph effects (polymorph other, baleful polymorph)
- Transformation effects
- Some transmutation magic

### 4. Breath Weapon

This saving throw is used against:
- Dragon breath of all types
- Hellhound breath
- Other creature breath weapons
- Cone, line, and cloud attacks

### 5. Spell

This saving throw is used against:
- Most spells that allow saving throws
- Spell-like abilities
- Magical effects not covered by other categories

## Saving Throw Tables

Each character class has its own saving throw table that improves as the character gains levels. Generally, fighters have the best saves against physical threats (breath weapons, poison), while clerics have good saves against death magic, and magic-users excel at resisting spells.

## Making Saving Throws

### Basic Procedure

1. Determine which saving throw category applies
2. Find the appropriate number on the character's saving throw table
3. Roll 1d20
4. If the roll equals or exceeds the number needed, the save is successful
5. Apply the effects of success or failure as specified by the spell, trap, or effect

### Success and Failure Effects

The effects of success or failure depend on the specific threat:

**Complete Negation**: Some effects (like charm person) are completely negated by a successful save.

**Half Damage**: Many damaging effects (like fireball) inflict half damage on a successful save.

**Partial Effect**: Some effects may be reduced in duration or severity on a successful save.

**Delayed Effect**: A few rare effects might be delayed rather than negated by a successful save.

## Saving Throw Modifiers

Various factors can modify saving throws:

### Ability Score Modifiers

**Wisdom** affects saves against magical effects:
- Wisdom 3: -3 penalty
- Wisdom 4: -2 penalty
- Wisdom 5-7: -1 penalty
- Wisdom 8-14: No modifier
- Wisdom 15: +1 bonus
- Wisdom 16: +2 bonus
- Wisdom 17: +3 bonus
- Wisdom 18: +4 bonus
- Wisdom 19: +4 bonus

**Constitution** affects saves against poison and death magic:
- Constitution 3: -2 penalty
- Constitution 4-6: -1 penalty
- Constitution 7-14: No modifier
- Constitution 15-16: No specific bonus
- Constitution 17: No specific bonus
- Constitution 18: No specific bonus
- Constitution 19: +1 bonus

**Dexterity** may affect saves against certain area effects (DM's discretion):
- High Dexterity may grant bonuses to saves against fireballs, lightning bolts, etc.
- Low Dexterity may impose penalties

### Racial Modifiers

**Dwarves**:
- +4 bonus against magic (including wands, staves, rods, and spells)
- +4 bonus against poison

**Gnomes**:
- +4 bonus against magic (including wands, staves, rods, and spells)
- +3 bonus against poison

**Halflings**:
- +4 bonus against magic (including wands, staves, rods, and spells)
- +4 bonus against poison

**Elves**:
- 90% resistance to sleep and charm spells (separate from saving throws)

**Half-Elves**:
- 30% resistance to sleep and charm spells (separate from saving throws)

### Magical Item Modifiers

**Cloaks of Protection**: Provide a bonus to all saving throws (+1 to +5)

**Rings of Protection**: Provide a bonus to all saving throws (+1 to +3)

**Specific Items**: Some items grant bonuses against specific threats (e.g., Ring of Fire Resistance)

### Situational Modifiers

The DM may assign situational modifiers based on circumstances:
- Cover or shelter: +1 to +4 against breath weapons
- Forewarning: +1 for prepared defenses
- Distraction: -1 to -4 if unable to properly defend
- Previous exposure: +1 to +2 against similar effects previously encountered

## Special Saving Throw Cases

### Magical Resistance

Some creatures have innate magic resistance, expressed as a percentage:
- Check magic resistance before making a saving throw
- If the resistance check succeeds, the creature is unaffected
- If the resistance check fails, the creature must make a normal saving throw

### Saving Throw Exceptions

Some effects do not allow saving throws:
- Magic missile (automatic hit)
- Power word spells (based on hit point thresholds)
- Certain death magic effects
- Some poisons and diseases

Other effects may allow saving throws with penalties:
- Particularly powerful spells
- Higher-level casters against lower-level targets
- Surprise or ambush situations

### Area of Effect Considerations

For area effect attacks (like dragon breath or fireball):
- All targets in the area make individual saving throws
- Cover may provide bonuses or automatic success
- Being at the edge of an effect may grant bonuses (DM's discretion)

## Tactical Considerations

### Improving Saving Throws

Characters can improve their chances of successful saves through:
- Gaining levels (all saves improve)
- Acquiring protective magic items
- Using spells like Protection from Evil
- Taking cover when possible
- Avoiding situations where saves are required

### Class Considerations

Different classes have different saving throw strengths:
- **Fighters**: Best against physical threats (breath weapons, poison)
- **Clerics**: Strong against death magic and poison
- **Magic-Users**: Best against spells and magical effects
- **Thieves**: Balanced saves, improving steadily with levels

### Multi-class Considerations

Multi-classed characters use the most favorable saving throw from among their classes for each category.

## Saving Throws in Practice

### Example 1: Dragon Breath

A 5th level fighter faces a red dragon's breath weapon:
1. Consult saving throw table: 5th level fighter needs 13 to save vs. breath weapon
2. Apply Constitution modifier: None
3. Apply racial modifier: +4 if the fighter is a dwarf
4. Roll d20: Result is 15
5. Compare to required roll: 15 > 13, save succeeds
6. Apply effect: Fighter takes half damage from the breath weapon

### Example 2: Poison

A 3rd level thief is struck by a poisoned needle trap:
1. Consult saving throw table: 3rd level thief needs 13 to save vs. poison
2. Apply Constitution modifier: +1 if Constitution is 19
3. Apply racial modifier: +4 if the thief is a halfling
4. Roll d20: Result is 10
5. Compare to required roll: 10 < 13, but with +4 racial bonus, 14 > 13, save succeeds
6. Apply effect: Thief resists the poison's effects

### Example 3: Spell

A 7th level magic-user is targeted by a charm person spell:
1. Consult saving throw table: 7th level magic-user needs 10 to save vs. spells
2. Apply Wisdom modifier: +1 if Wisdom is 15
3. Apply magical item bonus: +2 if wearing a Cloak of Protection +2
4. Roll d20: Result is 8
5. Compare to required roll: 8 + 1 + 2 = 11 > 10, save succeeds
6. Apply effect: Magic-user resists the charm attempt

## Saving Throws and Game Balance

Saving throws serve several important functions in the game:

### Character Survival

Saving throws provide characters with a chance to survive otherwise deadly threats, allowing for:
- Recovery from mistakes
- Defense against overwhelming forces
- Chance to overcome traps and hazards

### Class Differentiation

Different saving throw progressions help distinguish classes:
- Reinforces the fighter's physical resilience
- Highlights the magic-user's arcane knowledge
- Emphasizes the cleric's divine protection

### Level Progression

Improving saving throws are a key benefit of gaining levels:
- Higher-level characters are more likely to survive dangerous situations
- Represents increased experience and skill
- Balances increased threats faced at higher levels

### Risk Management

Saving throws introduce an element of risk management:
- Players must weigh the consequences of failure
- Tactical decisions become more meaningful
- Resource allocation (protective items, spells) becomes important
