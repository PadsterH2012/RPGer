# Attacks and Damage

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Attack Resolution

### Basic Attack Procedure

1. **Determine if attack is possible** (range, line of sight, etc.)
2. **Roll to hit** (d20 + modifiers vs. target's Armor Class)
3. **Determine if hit is successful** (compare to attack matrix)
4. **Roll damage** if attack hits
5. **Apply damage** to target's hit points

### Attack Matrices

Attack rolls in AD&D are resolved using matrices that cross-reference the attacker's class and level with the defender's Armor Class. Each class has its own attack matrix, with fighters (and subclasses) having the most favorable progression.

#### Sample Attack Matrix for Fighters:

| Level | AC 10 | AC 9 | AC 8 | AC 7 | AC 6 | AC 5 | AC 4 | AC 3 | AC 2 | AC 1 | AC 0 | AC -1 | AC -2 |
|-------|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| 1-2   | 10    | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   | 17   | 18   | 19   | 20   | 20    | 20    |
| 3-4   | 9     | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   | 17   | 18   | 19   | 20    | 20    |
| 5-6   | 8     | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   | 17   | 18   | 19    | 20    |
| 7-8   | 7     | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   | 17   | 18    | 19    |
| 9-10  | 6     | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16   | 17    | 18    |
| 11-12 | 5     | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   | 16    | 17    |
| 13-14 | 4     | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15    | 16    |
| 15-16 | 3     | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14    | 15    |
| 17+   | 2     | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13    | 14    |

The number in the matrix indicates the minimum roll needed on a d20 to hit the target AC.

### THAC0 (Alternative Method)

As an alternative to the attack matrices, some players use THAC0 (To Hit Armor Class 0):

1. Determine the attacker's THAC0 based on class and level
2. Subtract the target's AC from the THAC0
3. The result is the number needed to hit on a d20

For example, a 7th level fighter has a THAC0 of 14. To hit an opponent with AC 5:
- 14 (THAC0) - 5 (AC) = 9
- The fighter needs to roll a 9 or higher on a d20 to hit

## Attack Modifiers

## Damage

### Basic Damage Procedure

1. Roll the appropriate damage die for the weapon
2. Add or subtract any modifiers (Strength, magic, specialization, etc.)
3. Subtract the damage from the target's hit points

### Damage Modifiers

**Strength**: As listed in the attack modifiers section

**Magic Weapons**: Add the weapon's bonus to damage (+1 to +5)

**Specialization (Optional Rule)**: Fighters who specialize in a weapon gain +2 to damage

**Critical Hits (Optional Rule)**: Some DMs allow critical hits on a natural 20, which may double damage or have other effects

**Called Shots (Optional Rule)**: Attacks aimed at specific body parts may have penalties to hit but cause special effects if successful

## Special Attack Forms

### Multiple Attacks

Some characters and creatures can make multiple attacks per round:

**Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers:**
- Levels 1-6: 1 attack per round
- Levels 7-12: 3 attacks per 2 rounds
- Levels 13+: 2 attacks per round

**Monks:**
- Levels 1-2: 1 attack per round
- Levels 3-6: 3 attacks per 2 rounds
- Levels 7-10: 2 attacks per round
- Levels 11-14: 5 attacks per 2 rounds
- Levels 15+: 3 attacks per round

**Monsters:**
- As specified in their descriptions
- Multiple natural weapons (claw/claw/bite, etc.) are all used in a single round

### Backstab

Thieves can perform a special attack called a backstab:
- Must surprise the victim
- Must attack from behind
- Gains +4 bonus to hit
- Damage multiplier based on level:
  - Levels 1-4: ×2 damage
  - Levels 5-8: ×3 damage
  - Levels 9-12: ×4 damage
  - Levels 13+: ×5 damage

### Unarmed Combat

Unarmed attacks include punching and wrestling:

**Punching:**
- Attack roll made normally
- Damage is 1-2 points (1d3-1)
- Strength damage bonuses apply
- May stun opponent on a natural 20

**Wrestling:**
- Requires a successful hit roll
- Followed by an opposed Strength check
- Success allows holding, throwing, or immobilizing opponent
- No direct damage, but can render opponent helpless

### Mounted Combat

Fighting from horseback provides several advantages:
- Height advantage (+1 to hit against unmounted opponents)
- Charge attack with lance does double damage
- Movement rate allows for hit-and-run tactics
- Some penalties apply to certain weapons not suited for mounted use

### Missile Combat

Missile combat has several special considerations:

**Rate of Fire:**
- Varies by weapon (bows: 2/round, crossbows: 1/round or 1/2 rounds)
- Affected by Dexterity and specialization

**Range:**
- Short range: No penalty
- Medium range: -2 penalty
- Long range: -5 penalty

**Firing into Melee:**
- Risk of hitting allies
- Some DMs require a random determination of which target is hit

## Special Damage Types

### Fire

Fire damage comes from various sources:
- Burning oil: 2d6 first round, 1d6 second round
- Torch: 1d3
- Dragon breath: Varies by age and type

### Cold

Cold damage typically allows a saving throw for half damage:
- White dragon breath
- Certain spells (Cone of Cold, Ice Storm)

### Electricity

Electrical damage often affects multiple targets:
- Lightning bolt: 1d6 per level of caster
- Blue dragon breath
- Chain effects may reduce damage to secondary targets

### Poison

Poison typically requires a saving throw:
- Success may negate all effects or reduce damage
- Failure often causes death or severe damage
- Some poisons cause ability score damage instead of hit point loss

### Energy Drain

Energy drain is a special form of damage that reduces levels:
- Each level drained reduces hit dice, THAC0, and other level-based abilities
- No saving throw is typically allowed
- Restoration requires powerful magic

## Damage Effects

### Hit Point Loss

As characters lose hit points, they become increasingly wounded:
- Full hit points: Uninjured or minor scratches
- 50% hit points: Wounded but fully functional
- 25% hit points: Seriously wounded, may be bleeding
- 0 hit points: Unconscious and dying
- Negative hit points: Dead (in most cases)

### Death and Dying

The standard rule is that characters die at 0 hit points, but many DMs use house rules:
- Unconscious at 0, dead at -10
- Death at negative hit points equal to Constitution
- Chance to stabilize when dying

### Healing

Characters recover hit points through:
- Natural healing: 1 hit point per day of complete rest
- Light activity: 1 hit point per 2 days
- Magical healing: Cure Light Wounds (1d8), Cure Serious Wounds (2d8+1), etc.
- Healing potions: Similar to magical healing

## Combat Examples

### Example 1: Basic Melee Attack

A 5th level fighter (Strength 16) attacks an orc (AC 6) with a long sword:
1. Consult attack matrix: 5th level fighter needs 12 to hit AC 6
2. Roll d20: Result is 15
3. Add Strength modifier: 15 + 0 = 15
4. Compare to required roll: 15 > 12, attack hits
5. Roll damage: 1d8 (long sword) + 1 (Strength) = 5 damage
6. Orc loses 5 hit points

### Example 2: Missile Attack with Range Penalty

A 3rd level ranger (Dexterity 17) fires a long bow at a goblin (AC 7) at medium range:
1. Consult attack matrix: 3rd level ranger needs 12 to hit AC 7
2. Apply range penalty: -2 for medium range
3. Apply Dexterity bonus: +2 for Dexterity 17
4. Net modifier: -2 + 2 = 0
5. Roll d20: Result is 14
6. Compare to required roll: 14 > 12, attack hits
7. Roll damage: 1d6 = 4 damage
8. Goblin loses 4 hit points

### Example 3: Multiple Attacks

A 9th level fighter attacks a troll with a long sword:
1. Fighter gets 3 attacks per 2 rounds
2. In first round, fighter gets 2 attacks
3. In second round, fighter gets 1 attack
4. Each attack is resolved separately
5. Damage from each successful hit is applied to the troll

## Tactical Considerations

### Weapon Selection

Choose weapons based on:
- Damage potential
- Range
- Speed factor
- Opponent's armor type
- Available magical bonuses

### Positioning

Tactical positioning can provide advantages:
- Higher ground
- Flanking
- Rear attacks
- Bottlenecks for limiting multiple opponents

### Concentration of Force

Focus attacks on:
- Most dangerous opponents
- Spellcasters
- Wounded enemies to eliminate threats
- Opponents with poor armor class

### Retreat and Withdrawal

Know when to withdraw:
- Fighting withdrawal: Move at half speed while maintaining defense
- Full retreat: Move at full speed but provoke free attacks
- Cover retreating allies when possible
