# Combat Sequence

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Player's Handbook*

## Overview

Combat in AD&D is structured into rounds, each representing approximately one minute of game time. During this time, characters can move, attack, cast spells, use items, or perform other actions. The combat sequence ensures that actions occur in a logical order and that all participants have an opportunity to act.

## The Combat Round

A combat round consists of several segments and phases that determine when actions occur. The standard sequence is as follows:

1. **Determine Surprise** (if applicable)
2. **Establish Distances** between opponents
3. **Determine Initiative**
4. **Declare Actions** and movement
5. **Resolve Actions** in initiative order
6. **Assess Results** and adjust as needed

## Detailed Sequence

### 1. Determine Surprise

At the beginning of an encounter, check for surprise:
- Each side rolls 1d6
- A roll of 1 or 2 indicates surprise
- Surprised parties lose actions for 1 segment per pip (1-2 segments)
- If both sides are surprised, they effectively cancel out
- Some creatures or characters have bonuses or penalties to surprise rolls

**Special Surprise Situations:**
- Characters with high Dexterity may reduce surprise segments
- Some races (elves, halflings) are less likely to be surprised
- Some monsters have special surprise capabilities
- Certain magical items can prevent surprise

### 2. Establish Distances

The DM determines the starting distance between opposing forces:
- In dungeons, typically 10-40 feet (1-4")
- In wilderness, typically 10-100 yards (1-10")
- Surprise may reduce these distances
- Terrain and visibility can affect starting distances

### 3. Determine Initiative

Initiative determines which side acts first in combat:
- Each side rolls 1d6
- The higher roll wins initiative
- Ties indicate simultaneous action
- Initiative is typically rolled once per round for each side, not for individual characters

**Initiative Modifiers:**
- Dexterity adjustments (for individual characters)
- Weapon speed factors (optional rule)
- Spell casting time
- Creature size and speed
- Situational advantages/disadvantages

### 4. Declare Actions

Before resolving any actions, all participants declare their intended actions:
- Movement intentions
- Attack targets
- Spells to be cast
- Special maneuvers
- Item usage

The DM may require the losing side to declare actions first, giving the initiative winners a tactical advantage.

### 5. Resolve Actions

Actions are resolved in initiative order, with the winning side acting first:

**Movement Phase:**
- Characters can move up to their movement rate
- Movement can be split before and after attacks
- Running allows double movement but prevents attacking
- Charging allows 1.5Ã— movement and grants +2 to hit but -2 to AC

**Missile Combat Phase:**
- Ranged attacks occur before melee
- Rate of fire determines number of attacks
- Range penalties apply (-2 medium range, -5 long range)
- Cover and concealment may provide AC bonuses

**Spell Casting Phase:**
- Spells take effect in order of casting time
- Faster spells may interrupt slower ones
- Damage or distraction may disrupt spellcasting
- Concentration must be maintained throughout casting

**Melee Combat Phase:**
- Hand-to-hand combat occurs
- Multiple attacks (for high-level fighters, etc.) are resolved
- Special combat maneuvers are executed
- Creatures with multiple attack forms resolve all attacks

### 6. Assess Results

After all actions are resolved:
- Apply damage to appropriate targets
- Check for deaths, unconsciousness, or other effects
- Determine if morale checks are needed
- Adjust positions based on movement
- Prepare for the next round

## Surprise

Surprise represents the advantage gained by catching opponents unprepared:

### Checking for Surprise
- Each side rolls 1d6
- A roll of 1 or 2 indicates surprise
- If both sides are surprised, compare the results:
  - Equal results: No surprise advantage
  - Unequal results: The side with the lower result is surprised for the difference in segments

### Effects of Surprise
- Surprised characters cannot act during surprise segments
- Non-surprised characters gain free actions during surprise segments
- Attacks during surprise gain a +1 bonus to hit
- Some special attacks (backstab) require surprise

### Avoiding Surprise
- Vigilant characters are less likely to be surprised
- Some races have bonuses against surprise
- Magical items may prevent surprise
- Environmental awareness reduces surprise chances

## Initiative

Initiative determines the order of actions in combat:

### Basic Initiative System
- Each side rolls 1d6
- Higher roll wins initiative
- Ties indicate simultaneous action
- Initiative is re-rolled each round

### Individual Initiative (Optional Rule)
- Each character rolls 1d6, modified by Dexterity
- Actions are resolved in order from highest to lowest
- Ties are resolved simultaneously

### Initiative Modifiers
- **Dexterity**: High Dexterity provides bonuses, low Dexterity imposes penalties
- **Weapon Speed**: Faster weapons may strike first in ties
- **Spell Casting Time**: Affects when spells take effect
- **Situation**: Various circumstances may grant advantages or disadvantages

## Segmented Combat Round (Optional Rule)

For more detailed combat, the round can be divided into 10 segments:

1. Each participant has a base initiative segment determined by initiative roll
2. Actions occur on specific segments based on:
   - Weapon speed factor
   - Spell casting time
   - Movement rate
   - Special abilities
3. Multiple actions are spread throughout the round

This system allows for more tactical combat but increases complexity.

## Special Combat Situations

### Held Actions
- Characters can hold their action to respond to enemy movements
- Held actions can interrupt other actions if the trigger occurs
- If the trigger doesn't occur, the action may be lost

### Retreating from Combat
- Requires disengagement from melee
- May provoke free attacks from opponents
- Movement rate determines how quickly one can retreat

### Fighting Withdrawal
- Character backs away at 1/3 normal movement rate
- Maintains defensive posture
- Does not provoke free attacks

### Multiple Combatants
- Characters can be attacked by multiple opponents
- Defending against multiple attackers may impose penalties
- Positioning becomes important in group combat

## Combat Round Timing

While a combat round represents approximately one minute of game time, this is an abstraction that includes:
- Circling and feinting
- Looking for openings
- Minor repositioning
- Catching breath
- Adjusting equipment

The actual attacks represented by die rolls are only the most significant actions during this period.

## Example of Combat Sequence

1. A party of adventurers encounters a group of orcs in a dungeon corridor
2. Both sides roll for surprise (neither is surprised)
3. The DM establishes that the groups are 30 feet apart
4. Initiative is rolled: Players get 4, Orcs get 2 (Players win)
5. Players declare actions (fighter will charge, magic-user will cast Magic Missile, etc.)
6. Orcs declare actions (archers will fire, others will advance and attack)
7. Actions are resolved in order:
   - Player missile attacks
   - Player movement and spells
   - Orc missile attacks
   - Orc movement
   - Melee combat
8. Results are assessed, and the next round begins
