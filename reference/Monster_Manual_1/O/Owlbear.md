The owlbear is a monstrous creature with the body of a bear and the head of an owl. It attacks with its claws and beak. If it hits with both claws in the same round, it hugs its opponent for an additional 2-16 hit points of damage. Owlbears are found in forests and underground caverns. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack anything that enters their domain. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning fighters. Owlbears are particularly feared for their ferocity and their ability to hug opponents, which can crush even the strongest warrior. They are excellent trackers and can follow a scent trail for miles. Owlbears have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 90 feet. They have a distinctive screech that can be heard for miles, which they use to communicate with other owlbears and to warn intruders away from their territory. Owlbears are sometimes captured and trained by powerful beings to serve as guardians, though this is extremely dangerous due to their aggressive nature. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage.
