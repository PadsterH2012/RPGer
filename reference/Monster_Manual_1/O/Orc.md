Orcs are humanoid creatures with pig-like faces, pointed ears, and protruding tusks. They have coarse hair, reddish eyes, and greenish or grayish skin. They attack with various weapons, usually spears, axes, or short swords. They have infravision to 60'. They are sensitive to bright light, suffering a -1 penalty to attack rolls in sunlight or its equivalent. Orcs live in tribes in hills, mountains, and underground. They are aggressive and warlike, and often raid other settlements for food, slaves, and treasure. They are led by the strongest member of the tribe, who rules through fear and intimidation. Orcs speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. They are known for their cruelty and their hatred of elves and dwarves. Orcs are particularly effective in large groups, where their numbers can overwhelm stronger opponents. They are not very brave, and will often flee from a losing battle. Orcs have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can track prey for miles. Orcs are sometimes served by dire wolves or other predatory creatures, which they train as hunting beasts and guards. They are particularly vulnerable to bright light, which they find painful and disorienting.
