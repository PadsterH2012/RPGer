The otyugh is a bizarre creature with a large, bulbous body, three legs, and a long, flexible stalk with a fanged mouth at the end. It also has two long tentacles with sharp ridges. It attacks with its tentacles, which do 1-8 hit points of damage each, and its bite, which does 2-5 hit points of damage. Its bite also has a 30% chance of causing disease unless a saving throw versus poison is made. The disease causes the victim to be bedridden for 1-4 weeks, and has a 25% chance of being fatal. Otyughs are found in dungeons, caves, and other underground areas, where they feed on dung, carrion, and other refuse. They are intelligent enough to communicate in a limited fashion, and can sometimes be bargained with. They speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. Otyughs are particularly effective in their lairs, which are usually filled with filth and waste. They are immune to disease and can survive in the most fetid environments. Otyughs are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful creatures, who feed them with waste and the bodies of their enemies. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage. Otyughs are generally territorial and will attack anything that enters their domain, but they can sometimes be placated with offerings of food.
