Ogre magi are more intelligent and powerful cousins of normal ogres. They have blue-black skin, dark hair, and tusks protruding from their mouths. They attack with huge weapons, usually a two-handed sword or naginata, which do 1-12 hit points of damage plus a +4 bonus due to their strength. They can also use the following spell-like powers once per day: fly, invisibility, darkness 10' radius, polymorph self, charm person, sleep, and cone of cold. They can regenerate 1 hit point per round. Ogre magi are found in fortresses or castles in wilderness areas. They are intelligent and cunning, and often lead groups of normal ogres. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages. Ogre magi are particularly feared for their combination of physical strength and magical abilities, which makes them formidable opponents. They are excellent strategists and will use their powers to great effect in combat. Ogre magi are sometimes served by normal ogres, goblins, or other evil creatures, whom they rule through fear and intimidation. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which negates their regeneration ability. Ogre magi are often found in positions of leadership among evil humanoids, using their intelligence and magical abilities to dominate their less intelligent kin.
