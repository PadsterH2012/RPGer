Ogres are large, brutish humanoids with ugly features and great strength. They attack with huge weapons, usually a club or spear, which do 1-10 hit points of damage plus a +2 bonus due to their strength. They have infravision to 60'. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Ogres live in caves, ruins, or crude huts in wilderness areas. They form into small tribes led by the strongest member. They often enslave other creatures to serve them. Ogres speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. They are known for their great strength and their love of human flesh. Ogres are particularly fond of eating humans and demihumans, and will often raid settlements for food and slaves. They are lazy by nature and prefer to let their slaves do most of the work, but they are fierce fighters when roused to battle. Ogres have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can track prey for miles. Ogres are sometimes served by dire wolves or other predatory creatures, which they train as hunting beasts and guards.
