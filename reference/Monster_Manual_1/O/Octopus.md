Octopi are eight-armed marine mollusks with soft, bulbous bodies. They attack with their tentacles, each of which does 1-3 hit points of damage. If a tentacle hits, it constricts for an additional 1-3 hit points of damage per round until the victim breaks free. Octopi can also emit a cloud of ink 3' in diameter, which obscures vision and allows them to escape. They can change color to match their surroundings, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls. Octopi are found in oceans and seas, where they live in caves and crevices. They are not aggressive unless threatened, but will defend themselves if necessary. They are excellent swimmers and can squeeze through openings as small as 3 inches in diameter. Octopi are known for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities, which are exceptional for animals. They are particularly effective at hiding and ambushing prey, using their color-changing abilities and ink cloud to great effect. Octopi are sometimes kept as pets or familiars by aquatic races, who value their intelligence and versatility. They are particularly vulnerable when out of water, as they cannot breathe air and will suffocate if not returned to water within a few minutes.

**Giant Octopus**:
AC: 7; Move: 3"//9"; HD: 8; Damage: 1-6 (x8); Special Attacks: Constriction (2-12); Size: L (20' long)

Giant octopi are larger, more aggressive versions of normal octopi. They attack with their tentacles, each of which does 1-6 hit points of damage. If a tentacle hits, it constricts for an additional 2-12 hit points of damage per round until the victim breaks free. Giant octopi can also emit a cloud of ink 20' in diameter. They are found in deep ocean waters, where they prey on fish, sharks, and even small whales. They are particularly feared by sailors, as they can attack ships from below and drag crew members underwater to drown.
