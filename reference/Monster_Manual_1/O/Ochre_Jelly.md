The ochre jelly is a yellowish-brown amoeboid creature that can flow through small cracks and openings. It attacks by striking with a pseudopod, which does 3-12 hit points of damage from its acidic secretions. This acid dissolves organic material but does not affect metal or stone. The ochre jelly is immune to lightning and attacks from blunt weapons, both of which cause it to divide into two smaller jellies, each with half the original's hit points. It can be harmed by fire and cold. The ochre jelly is found in dungeons, caves, and other underground areas, where it feeds on organic matter. It is not intelligent, and will attack anything that comes within reach. The ochre jelly is particularly dangerous because it can flow through small openings and attack from unexpected directions. It can climb walls and ceilings, and can squeeze through cracks as small as 1 inch wide. Ochre jellies reproduce by division, with each piece growing into a new jelly. They are immune to poison and most other effects that target living creatures, as they have no internal organs or conventional biology. Ochre jellies are particularly feared by adventurers because they can destroy equipment and clothing with their acid, leaving victims naked and unarmed.
