Giant owls are larger, more intelligent versions of normal owls. They attack with their talons and beak. They can fly silently, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls. They have excellent night vision and can see in darkness as if it were daylight. Giant owls are found in deep forests, where they build nests in large trees or caves. They are intelligent and generally benevolent, and will sometimes aid good-aligned beings in need. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages. Giant owls are particularly effective at night, when their silent flight and excellent vision give them a significant advantage over most prey. They are sometimes used as mounts by elves, halflings, or other small humanoids, who value their intelligence and flying ability. Giant owls are known for their wisdom and their ability to see through deception, which makes them valuable allies and dangerous enemies. They are particularly vulnerable to bright light, which blinds them temporarily and causes them discomfort. Giant owls are generally peaceful, but will defend their nests and young fiercely if threatened. They are sometimes served by normal owls, who act as scouts and messengers for their larger cousins.
