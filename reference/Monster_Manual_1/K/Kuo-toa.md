Kuo-toa are fish-like humanoids that dwell in deep, underground waters. They have pale, pinkish-white skin, bulging eyes, and webbed hands and feet. They attack with various weapons, usually spears, tridents, or nets. They can also use their bite, which does 1-4 hit points of damage. Kuo-toa have excellent vision and can see in normal and magical darkness. They are immune to poison and paralysis, and are 80% resistant to illusions. They can only be surprised on a 1 on a d10. If a kuo-toa is hit by both a pincer staff and a shield, the victim must save versus paralysis or be held immobile for 2-8 rounds. Kuo-toa hate surface dwellers and will attack them on sight. They worship the sea goddess Blibdoolpoolp, and their society is dominated by clerics of this deity. Kuo-toa speak their own language and can communicate with most intelligent aquatic creatures. They are excellent swimmers and can breathe both air and water. Their skin secretes a slimy substance that makes them difficult to grapple and gives them a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells that affect mobility.
