Kobolds are small, reptilian humanoids with scaly skin ranging from dark rusty brown to black, and red eyes. They attack with various weapons, usually spears, short swords, or axes. They have infravision to 60'. They are cowardly and cruel, and prefer to attack from ambush or with overwhelming numbers. They live in caves, ruins, or crude huts in wilderness areas. They are often led by more powerful individuals, such as shamans or witch doctors. They are enemies of most other races, especially gnomes and dwarves. Kobolds speak their own language and can sometimes speak the common tongue. They are skilled miners and often dig extensive tunnel networks. They have a natural affinity for traps and ambushes, and their lairs are usually well-defended with various snares and pitfalls.
