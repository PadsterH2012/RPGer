Goblins are small, humanoid creatures with flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide mouths, and small, sharp fangs. Their skin ranges from yellow to orange to red, and they have red or yellow eyes. They attack with various weapons, usually spears, short swords, or bows. They have infravision to 60'. They are cowardly and cruel, and prefer to attack from ambush or with overwhelming numbers. They live in caves, ruins, or crude huts in wilderness areas. They are often led by more powerful individuals, such as hobgoblins or bugbears. They are enemies of most other races, especially gnomes and dwarves. Goblins speak their own language and can sometimes speak the common tongue. They are skilled miners and often dig extensive tunnel networks. They have a natural affinity for wolves and worgs, which they train as mounts and hunting beasts. Goblins are particularly vulnerable to sunlight, suffering a -1 penalty to attack rolls in bright light. They are known for their cunning and their ability to set traps and ambushes. Goblins reproduce quickly and can establish large communities in a short time if left unchecked.
