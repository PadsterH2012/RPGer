Ghosts are the spectral remnants of humans or demihumans who died violently and have been denied rest. They appear as translucent, glowing humanoid figures. They attack by touch, which ages the victim 10-40 years. They can also use a magic jar ability to possess a victim within 3", and can cause fear in a 3" radius (save versus spells or flee in terror for 2-12 rounds). Ghosts can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and electricity. They can be turned by clerics. Ghosts can become ethereal at will, and can only be attacked when they are on the Material Plane. Ghosts are found in ruins, graveyards, and other desolate places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and are bound to the site of their death or to a particular object. Ghosts speak the common tongue and several other languages from their mortal life. They are particularly feared for their ability to age victims and possess their bodies. Ghosts are often created when a person dies in a particularly traumatic or unjust way, and their spirit is unable to rest until they achieve some form of closure or vengeance.
