Giants are huge humanoids that tower over humans and most other creatures. They are divided into several types, each with its own unique characteristics and habitat. All giants are immensely strong and can hurl boulders as weapons. They attack with huge weapons or their fists, and can cause tremendous damage due to their size and strength. Giants are intelligent and can speak their own language, as well as the common tongue and several other languages. They often live in remote areas, away from human civilization. Giants are particularly feared for their ability to hurl boulders, which can devastate entire groups of adventurers from a distance. They are also known for their tremendous strength, which allows them to wield weapons that would be impossible for humans to lift. Giants often keep other creatures as servants or slaves, and may form alliances with other powerful beings. Despite their fearsome reputation, not all giants are evil, and some may be willing to negotiate or even aid adventurers under the right circumstances.
