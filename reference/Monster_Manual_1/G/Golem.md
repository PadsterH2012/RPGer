Golems are magically created automatons of great power. They are created from various materials, such as clay, flesh, iron, or stone, and are animated by elemental spirits bound into them by powerful magic. Golems are immune to most spells, poison, and normal weapons. They are semi-intelligent, and follow the commands of their creator exactly. Golems are found guarding important locations or serving powerful spellcasters. They are not aggressive unless commanded to attack or unless their programming is triggered by specific events. Golems cannot speak, but can understand the commands of their creator. They are particularly feared for their immunity to most forms of attack and their relentless pursuit of their goals. Golems are often created with specific weaknesses or flaws, which clever adventurers can exploit. They are sometimes prone to berserk rages or other malfunctions, which can make them dangerous even to their creators. Golems are not living creatures and do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe. They can function indefinitely unless destroyed.
