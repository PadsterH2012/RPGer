Flesh golems are man-like figures made from pieces of human corpses stitched together. They are only affected by magical weapons, and they are immune to all spells except fire and electrical attacks. Fire and cold slow them for 2-12 rounds, and electrical attacks "heal" all damage. There is a 1% cumulative chance per round of combat that a flesh golem will go berserk, attacking the nearest living creature until it is destroyed or the golem is destroyed.

Flesh golems can only be created by magic-users of at least 14th level. The process requires body parts from at least six different human corpses, rare earths and herbs worth at least 30,000 gold pieces, and the casting of animate dead, charm monster, limited wish, polymorph any object, and protection from normal missiles.
