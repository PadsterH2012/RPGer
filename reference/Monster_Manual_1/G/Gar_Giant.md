Giant gars are large, predatory fish with long, tooth-filled snouts. They attack with their powerful bite, which does 4-16 hit points of damage. If they score a natural 20 on their attack roll, they swallow their victim whole. Swallowed creatures take 1-6 hit points of damage per round from digestive acids, and will die after 6 rounds. Giant gars are found in rivers, lakes, and swamps. They are aggressive hunters and will attack anything that enters their territory. They are not intelligent, and rely on instinct to hunt and survive. Giant gars have tough, armored scales that provide excellent protection against attacks. They are excellent swimmers and can move through water with incredible speed and agility. Giant gars are particularly feared by fishermen and others who work on the water, as they can capsize small boats and drag victims underwater. Their meat is edible but tough and oily, and their scales can be used to make primitive armor.
