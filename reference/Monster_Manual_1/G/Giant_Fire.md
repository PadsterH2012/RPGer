Fire giants are muscular humanoids with coal-black skin and flaming red or orange hair. They attack with huge weapons, usually a sword or axe, which do 5-30 hit points of damage. They can also hurl rocks for 2-20 hit points of damage. Fire giants are immune to fire and heat. They live in castles or fortresses built near volcanoes or in other hot regions. They are intelligent and militaristic, and often wage war on other creatures. Fire giants speak their own language, the common tongue, and the languages of all other giant types. They are skilled metalworkers and often craft powerful weapons and armor. Fire giants are known for their disciplined, regimented society, which is organized along military lines. They are particularly fond of combat and often train for battle even during times of peace. Fire giants are sometimes served by hell hounds, fire elementals, or other fire-dwelling creatures. They are implacable enemies who will pursue vendettas for generations.
