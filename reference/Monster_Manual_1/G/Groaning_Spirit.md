The groaning spirit, or banshee, is the spirit of an evil female elf. It appears as a translucent, glowing humanoid figure. It attacks with its touch, which does 1-8 hit points of damage. Once per day, it can keen, which kills all within 3" who fail a saving throw versus death magic. It can also use the following spell-like powers at will: detect invisibility, detect magic, and dispel magic. It can use the following spell-like powers once per day: know alignment, locate object, and magic jar. Groaning spirits can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, electricity, and poison. They can be turned by clerics. Groaning spirits are found in desolate moors and other lonely places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. Groaning spirits speak the common tongue and several other languages from their mortal life. They are particularly feared for their keening, which can kill entire groups of adventurers instantly. Groaning spirits are often created when an evil female elf dies a violent death, and their spirit is unable to rest until they achieve some form of closure or vengeance.
