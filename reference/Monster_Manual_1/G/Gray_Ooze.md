The gray ooze is a slimy, amorphous creature that resembles wet stone. It attacks by touching its victim, which does 2-16 hit points of damage from its acidic secretions. This acid also dissolves metal at a rate of 1" thickness per round, but does not affect stone or wood. The gray ooze is immune to cold, fire, and lightning. It can be harmed by weapons and most spells. The gray ooze is found in dungeons, caves, and other underground areas, where it feeds on organic matter. It is not intelligent, and will attack anything that comes within reach. The gray ooze is particularly dangerous because it is difficult to detect, often being mistaken for a puddle of water or a patch of damp stone. It can squeeze through small cracks and openings, and can climb walls and ceilings. Gray oozes reproduce by division, splitting into two smaller oozes when they reach a certain size. They are immune to poison and most other effects that target living creatures, as they have no internal organs or conventional biology.
