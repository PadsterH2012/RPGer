Storm giants are the largest and most powerful of all giants. They have bronze skin and hair ranging from deep blue to sea green. They attack with huge weapons, usually a two-handed sword or trident, which do 7-42 hit points of damage. They can also hurl rocks for 3-30 hit points of damage. Storm giants can control weather once per day, and can breathe underwater. They are immune to lightning. They live in cloud castles, mountain peaks, or underwater palaces. They are intelligent and noble, and rarely interfere with the affairs of lesser beings unless provoked. Storm giants speak their own language, the common tongue, and the languages of all other giant types. They are skilled in magic and often have magical items. Storm giants are known for their wisdom and their ability to see the future through dreams and omens. They are particularly fond of music and poetry, and are skilled harpists. Storm giants are sometimes served by griffons, hippogriffs, or other flying creatures. They are the most powerful and respected of all giant types, and even evil giants will think twice before challenging them.
