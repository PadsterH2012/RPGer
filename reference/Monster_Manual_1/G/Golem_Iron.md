Iron golems are man-like figures of iron animated by a spirit from the elemental plane of earth. They are only affected by magical weapons of at least +3 enchantment, and they are immune to all spells except lightning and fire. Lightning slows them for 3 rounds, and fire "heals" all damage. Iron golems can breathe a cloud of poison gas 10' wide and 10' long, which kills any creature that fails a saving throw versus poison.

Iron golems can only be created by magic-users of at least 18th level. The process requires an iron statue, rare earths and herbs worth at least 100,000 gold pieces, and the casting of cloudkill, geas, limited wish, polymorph any object, and slow.
