Green slime is a plant-like organism that clings to walls, ceilings, and floors in dungeons and caves. It drops onto passing creatures or attaches itself to them when touched. On contact, it secretes an enzyme that dissolves flesh and organic material, turning the victim into green slime in 1-4 rounds unless the slime is scraped off or killed with fire, cold, or cure disease. Metal and wood are dissolved in 6 rounds. Green slime is immune to all attacks except fire, cold, and cure disease. It can be scraped off quickly if detected immediately, but after 1 round it adheres too strongly to remove. Green slime is found in dungeons, caves, and other dark, damp places. It is not intelligent, and has no attacks other than its dissolving touch. Green slime is particularly dangerous because it is often mistaken for harmless moss or lichen until it is too late. It can squeeze through small cracks and openings, and can cling to walls and ceilings. Green slime reproduces by division, with each piece of slime growing into a new organism. It is immune to poison and most other effects that target living creatures, as it has no internal organs or conventional biology.
