Gnomes are small, humanoid creatures related to dwarves. They have tan or brown skin, white hair, and large noses. They attack with various weapons, usually hammers, picks, or short swords. They have infravision to 60', and can detect sloping passages, unsafe walls, ceilings, or floors, and approximate depth and direction underground on a 1-5 on a d6. They gain a +1 bonus to hit kobolds and goblins, and a -4 bonus to saving throws against magic and poison. They are resistant to magic, gaining a +1 bonus to saving throws for every 3Â½ points of Constitution. Gnomes typically live in hills and forests, where they build elaborate underground burrows. They are excellent miners and craftsmen, especially with gems and jewelry. They are long-lived, with a lifespan of 350 years or more. Gnomes speak their own language, dwarf, halfling, goblin, kobold, and the common tongue. Gnomes are known for their love of jokes and pranks, and their friendly, outgoing nature. They are particularly skilled at illusion magic, and many gnome illusionists are renowned for their abilities. They have a natural enmity toward kobolds and goblins, and will often go out of their way to fight these creatures. Gnomes have a special affinity for burrowing mammals, and often keep badgers, moles, or similar creatures as pets.
