Gargoyles are magical creatures that resemble grotesque, winged humanoids with horns, talons, and fangs. They attack with their claws, bite, and horns. They can only be hit by magical weapons of at least +1 enchantment. Gargoyles can fly despite their great weight due to their magical nature. They are found on buildings, ruins, and in underground caverns. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. Gargoyles can remain motionless for long periods, appearing to be stone statues, which allows them to surprise their victims. They speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. Gargoyles are particularly fond of ambushing lone travelers or small groups. They are often used as guardians by evil spellcasters, as they are loyal servants if treated well. Gargoyles are immune to sleep and charm spells, and are resistant to cold and heat due to their stone-like nature. They have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet.
