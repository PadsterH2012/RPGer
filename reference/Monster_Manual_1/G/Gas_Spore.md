Gas spores are fungoid creatures that resemble beholders. They float through the air and are often mistaken for beholders due to their similar appearance, complete with a large central "eye" and smaller eyestalks. However, these features are non-functional and purely cosmetic. If a gas spore is touched or damaged, it explodes in a 20' radius. All within this area take 6-36 hit points of damage (save versus poison for half damage). The explosion also releases spores which infect any creature that fails its saving throw. These spores grow inside the victim, killing them in 24 hours unless a cure disease spell is used. Gas spores are found in dungeons and caves, where they feed on decaying organic matter. They are not intelligent, and have no attacks other than their explosion. Gas spores reproduce by releasing spores when they explode, which can grow into new gas spores within a few days in suitable conditions. Gas spores are particularly dangerous because they are often mistaken for beholders, causing adventurers to either flee unnecessarily or attack unwisely. Their explosion can be devastating in enclosed spaces, and the spores they release can cause a lingering death if not treated promptly.
