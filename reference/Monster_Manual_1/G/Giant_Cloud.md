Cloud giants are tall, muscular humanoids with skin ranging from pale blue to white. They attack with huge weapons, usually a morningstar or club, which do 6-36 hit points of damage. They can also hurl rocks for 2-20 hit points of damage. Cloud giants can levitate at will, and can create fog clouds three times per day. They live in castles built on mountain peaks or on clouds. They are intelligent and generally peaceful, but will defend their territory if threatened. Cloud giants speak their own language, the common tongue, and the languages of all other giant types. They are particularly fond of music and fine food, and are skilled craftsmen. Cloud giants are known for their ability to smell out hidden or invisible creatures, which they can detect up to 60 feet away. They are also skilled at weather prediction and can sense approaching storms up to a day in advance. Cloud giants often keep pegasi, griffons, or other flying creatures as mounts or pets. They are sometimes willing to aid travelers who show proper respect and offer suitable gifts.
