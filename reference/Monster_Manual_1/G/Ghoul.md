Ghouls are undead creatures that feed on the flesh of corpses. They appear as emaciated humanoids with sharp claws and teeth. They attack with their claws and bite. Any creature hit by a ghoul must save versus paralyzation or be paralyzed for 3-12 rounds. Elves are immune to this paralyzation. Ghouls are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. They can be turned by clerics. Ghouls are found in graveyards, battlefields, and other places where the dead are buried. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning hunters. They speak a debased form of the common tongue. Ghouls are particularly feared for their ability to paralyze victims, making them helpless as they are torn apart and devoured. Ghouls cannot cross running water unless it is bridged, and they are repelled by the smell of elves, which they find offensive. Ghouls reproduce by feeding their paralyzed victims the flesh of other ghouls, which transforms the victim into a ghoul upon death. They are often found in packs, working together to overwhelm stronger opponents.
