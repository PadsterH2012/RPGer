Griffons are magical beasts with the body of a lion and the head, wings, and forelegs of an eagle. They attack with their eagle claws and lion-like bite. They are excellent flyers and can carry up to 300 pounds in flight. Griffons are found in hills and mountains, where they build nests on high, inaccessible ledges. They are intelligent enough to be trained, but are aggressive and territorial in the wild. They have a particular fondness for horse flesh, and will always attack horses if they are within 36" unless restrained. Griffons mate for life and typically produce clutches of 1-6 eggs which both parents help to raise. Griffons are sometimes captured and trained as mounts by humans and other humanoids. This is a difficult and dangerous process, but a trained griffon is a loyal and powerful ally. Griffon eggs and young are highly valued, with a single egg worth up to 5,000 gold pieces. Griffons have excellent eyesight and can spot movement from miles away. They are particularly protective of their nesting grounds and will attack any creature that threatens their young.
