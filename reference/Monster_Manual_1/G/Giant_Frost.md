Frost giants are huge humanoids with pale blue or white skin, and pale yellow or blue hair. They attack with huge weapons, usually a battle axe or great sword, which do 4-24 hit points of damage. They can also hurl rocks for 2-20 hit points of damage. Frost giants are immune to cold. They live in ice castles or fortresses in arctic regions. They are intelligent and aggressive, and often raid other settlements for food and treasure. Frost giants speak their own language, the common tongue, and the languages of all other giant types. They are skilled hunters and trackers, and often keep winter wolves or other cold-dwelling creatures as pets. Frost giants are known for their love of combat and their fierce tribal loyalties. They are particularly fond of drinking and feasting, and their halls often ring with boisterous songs and tales of battle. Frost giants are sometimes served by white dragons, winter wolves, or other cold-dwelling creatures. They are implacable enemies of fire giants and will attack them on sight.
