Giant goats are larger, more aggressive versions of normal goats. They attack by butting with their horns, which does 2-8 hit points of damage. If they can charge for at least 30', they gain a +2 bonus to hit and do double damage. Giant goats are found in hills and mountains, where they graze on vegetation. They are not aggressive unless threatened, but will defend themselves and their young fiercely. Giant goats are excellent climbers and can navigate steep, rocky terrain with ease. They are sometimes domesticated by hill giants, ogres, or other large humanoids, who use them as mounts or beasts of burden. Giant goats are known for their stubbornness and their ability to eat almost any vegetation, no matter how tough or unpalatable. They are particularly valuable in mountainous regions where other livestock would struggle to survive. Giant goats produce milk that is rich and nutritious, and their thick wool can be used to make warm clothing. Their horns are prized for making tools and decorative items.
