Clay golems are man-like figures of clay animated by a spirit from the elemental plane of earth. They are only affected by blunt magical weapons, and they are immune to all spells except move earth (which slows them for 2-12 rounds), disintegrate (which "heals" them completely), and earthquake (which affects them as a slow spell for 1 round). Clay golems are damaged by normal water, taking 1 hit point of damage per gallon. There is a 1% cumulative chance per round of combat that a clay golem will go berserk, attacking the nearest living creature until it is destroyed or the golem is destroyed.

Clay golems can only be created by clerics of at least 17th level. The process requires a clay statue, rare earths and herbs worth at least 50,000 gold pieces, and the casting of animate object, commune, prayer, resurrection, and stone shape.
