The gorgon is a magical beast that resembles a bull with iron scales. It attacks with its horns, which do 2-12 hit points of damage. It can also breathe a cone of gas 6" long, 2" wide at the base, and 2" wide at the end. Any creature caught in this gas must save versus petrification or be turned to stone. The gorgon can use this breath weapon once every 5 rounds. Gorgons are found in plains and hills, where they graze on vegetation and occasionally hunt other creatures. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack anything that enters their domain. Gorgons are not intelligent, and rely on instinct to hunt and survive. They are particularly feared for their petrifying breath, which can turn entire groups of adventurers to stone in seconds. Gorgons are sometimes captured and trained by powerful beings to serve as guardians or mounts, though this is extremely dangerous due to their aggressive nature and their breath weapon. Their iron-like scales are highly valued for making armor and other items, and a single gorgon hide can be worth up to 5,000 gold pieces.
