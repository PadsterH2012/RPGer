Gnolls are tall, humanoid hyenas with coarse fur ranging from reddish-brown to yellow. They attack with various weapons, usually spears, battle axes, or flails. They are strong and aggressive, and enjoy bullying weaker creatures. Gnolls live in ruins, caves, or crude huts in wilderness areas. They form into loosely organized tribes led by the strongest member. They often enslave other creatures to serve them. Gnolls speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. They are known for their distinctive barking laugh, which they often emit during combat. Gnolls are particularly fond of human flesh, and will often raid human settlements for food and slaves. They are lazy by nature and prefer to let their slaves do most of the work, but they are fierce fighters when roused to battle. Gnolls have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can track prey for miles. Gnolls are sometimes served by hyenas or hyaenodons, which they train as hunting beasts and guards.
