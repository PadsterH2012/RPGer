Stone golems are man-like figures of stone animated by a spirit from the elemental plane of earth. They are only affected by magical weapons of at least +2 enchantment, and they are immune to all spells except stone to flesh (which slows them for 2-12 rounds), transmute rock to mud (which slows them for 2-12 rounds), and passwall (which negates their slow ability for 1-6 rounds). Stone golems can cast slow once every other round.

Stone golems can only be created by magic-users of at least 16th level. The process requires a stone statue, rare earths and herbs worth at least 80,000 gold pieces, and the casting of geas, polymorph any object, slow, stone shape, and wish.
