Stone giants are tall, lean humanoids with stone-gray skin and dark eyes. They attack with huge clubs or other weapons, which do 3-18 hit points of damage. They can also hurl rocks for 3-30 hit points of damage. Stone giants are particularly skilled at rock throwing, gaining a +2 bonus to hit with thrown rocks. They live in caves or stone huts in mountainous regions. They are not aggressive, but will defend their territory if threatened. Stone giants speak their own language, the common tongue, and the languages of all other giant types. They are skilled stoneworkers and often carve elaborate designs into the walls of their homes. Stone giants are known for their ability to blend in with rocky terrain, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls in such environments. They are particularly fond of games involving throwing and catching rocks, and will often engage in such activities for entertainment. Stone giants are sometimes served by cave bears, dire wolves, or other mountain-dwelling creatures. They are generally neutral in the conflicts between good and evil giants, preferring to remain isolated in their mountain homes.
