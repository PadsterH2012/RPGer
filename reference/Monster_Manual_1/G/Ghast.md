Ghasts are undead creatures that resemble ghouls but are more powerful. They attack with their claws and bite. Any creature hit by a ghast must save versus paralyzation or be paralyzed for 3-12 rounds. Elves are immune to this paralyzation. Ghasts also emit a carrion stench in a 10' radius. Any creature within this radius must save versus poison or be nauseated, suffering a -2 penalty to attack rolls. Ghasts are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. They can be turned by clerics. Ghasts are found in graveyards, ruins, and other desolate places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. Ghasts speak the common tongue and several other languages from their mortal life. They are particularly feared for their ability to paralyze victims and their nauseating stench. Ghasts are often found leading packs of ghouls, which they dominate through their greater intelligence and power. Unlike ghouls, ghasts are not stopped by the smell of elves, and can cross running water. They are particularly vulnerable to cold iron weapons, which do double damage to them.
