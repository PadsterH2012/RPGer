The gelatinous cube is a nearly transparent cube of protoplasm that moves through dungeon corridors, absorbing debris and organic material. It attacks by touching its victim, which does 2-8 hit points of damage and requires the victim to save versus paralyzation or be paralyzed for 5-20 rounds. A paralyzed victim is drawn into the cube's body and digested over the course of 5-10 rounds, taking 1-4 hit points of damage per round. The gelatinous cube is immune to cold, lightning, fear, hold, paralyzation, polymorph, and sleep spells. It takes normal damage from weapons and fire. The gelatinous cube is found in dungeons, where it cleans corridors of debris and organic material. It is not intelligent, and will attack anything that comes within reach. The gelatinous cube often contains indigestible items such as gems, coins, and magic items, which can be seen floating within its transparent body. These items are the remains of previous victims and can be recovered if the cube is killed. Gelatinous cubes are particularly dangerous because they are nearly invisible, and are often not noticed until they attack. They are also feared for their ability to paralyze victims, making them helpless as they are slowly digested.
