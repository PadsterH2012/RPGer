Sphinxes are magical creatures with the body of a lion and the head of another creature, depending on the type of sphinx. They are intelligent and often pose riddles or questions to those who encounter them. There are four main types of sphinx: androsphinx, criosphinx, gynosphinx, and hieracosphinx. All sphinxes are excellent flyers despite their great weight due to their magical nature. They are found in deserts, ruins, and other remote areas. They are particularly feared for their combination of physical power, magical abilities, and intelligence, which makes them formidable opponents. They are often found guarding ancient treasures or sacred sites, and will defend these locations fiercely. Sphinxes are sometimes served by other creatures, who respect their power and wisdom. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which slows their movements and reduces their effectiveness in combat.
