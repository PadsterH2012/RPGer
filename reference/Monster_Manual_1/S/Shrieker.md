Shriekers are large, mushroom-like fungi that emit a loud noise when disturbed. They have no physical attacks, but their shriek lasts for 1-3 rounds and can be heard up to 240 feet away. This noise has a 50% chance of attracting wandering monsters. Shriekers will emit their shriek when they detect light within 30 feet or movement within 10 feet. Shriekers are found in dark, damp places underground. They are not intelligent, and rely on their shriek to attract creatures that will spread their spores. They are often found in the company of violet fungi, which kill creatures attracted by the shriekers. Shriekers are particularly dangerous because they can alert nearby monsters to the presence of adventurers. They are immune to mind-affecting spells due to their lack of intelligence. Shriekers reproduce by releasing spores, which can grow into new shriekers within a few days in suitable conditions. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they have no defense against. Shriekers are sometimes used as alarm systems by intelligent dungeon dwellers, who place them near entrances or important areas.
