Skeletons are animated bones of the dead, created by evil wizards or clerics to serve as guardians or soldiers. They attack with whatever weapons they are given, usually swords or spears. They are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells, as well as to cold-based attacks and poison. They can be turned by clerics. Skeletons are found in dungeons, ruins, and graveyards, where they guard treasures or patrol endlessly. They are not intelligent, and follow the simple instructions of their creator. They speak no languages. Skeletons can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They make no noise when moving, which can make them difficult to detect. Skeletons do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and can function indefinitely unless destroyed. They are often used as expendable troops by evil spellcasters, as they require no maintenance and follow orders without question. Skeletons can be created from the bones of any humanoid creature, though human skeletons are the most common. They are particularly vulnerable to blunt weapons, which do full damage to them, while edged and piercing weapons do less damage.
