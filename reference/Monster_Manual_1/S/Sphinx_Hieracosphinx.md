The hieracosphinx is a sphinx with the head of a hawk. It attacks with its claws and beak. It is the most aggressive and evil of all sphinxes, and will attack anything that enters its territory. Hieracosphinxes are found in deserts and other remote areas, where they guard treasures and ancient sites. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Hieracosphinxes speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. They are known for their great strength and their ability to fly, which makes them formidable opponents. They are excellent flyers despite their great weight due to their magical nature. Hieracosphinxes are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful evil beings, as they are loyal servants if treated well. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage. Hieracosphinxes are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are particularly fond of human flesh, and will often keep prisoners to devour later.
