The criosphinx is a sphinx with the head of a ram. It attacks with its powerful claws, each of which does 2-12 hit points of damage. Criosphinxes are found in deserts and other remote areas, where they guard treasures and ancient sites. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Criosphinxes speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. They are known for their great strength and their ability to fly, which makes them formidable opponents. They are excellent flyers despite their great weight due to their magical nature. Criosphinxes are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful beings, as they are loyal servants if treated well. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage. Criosphinxes are generally hostile to all other creatures, but will sometimes negotiate if offered sufficient treasure. They are particularly fond of gold and gems, and will often demand payment for safe passage through their territory.
