Stirges are bird-like creatures with long, sharp proboscises. They attack by landing on a victim and inserting their proboscis, which does 1-3 hit points of damage. Once attached, they drain blood at a rate of 1-4 hit points per round. They will remain attached until they have drained 12 hit points of blood, at which point they will detach and fly away to digest their meal. Stirges are found in dungeons, caves, and other dark places. They are not intelligent, and rely on instinct to hunt and survive. They are particularly dangerous in large groups, as they can quickly overwhelm even the strongest warrior with their numbers. Stirges have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 90 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can detect blood from great distances. Stirges are known for their ability to drain blood, which makes them feared by adventurers and other dungeon dwellers. They are excellent flyers and can hover in place. Stirges are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful creatures, who lure them to specific areas with regular feedings. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage.
