The shambling mound, or shambler, is a plant-like creature that resembles a heap of rotting vegetation. It attacks with its huge, arm-like appendages, each of which does 2-16 hit points of damage. If both arms hit the same victim in the same round, the shambler engulfs the victim and suffocates them in 2-8 rounds unless they are freed. The shambler is immune to fire and cold. Lightning does not harm it, but instead causes it to grow, adding 1 hit die to its total. It takes only half damage from weapons. Shamblers are found in swamps, marshes, and other wet areas. They are intelligent enough to use simple tactics, such as ambushing prey or retreating if outmatched. They speak no languages. Shamblers are particularly feared for their ability to suffocate victims and their resistance to most forms of attack. They are excellent at hiding in swampy terrain, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls in such environments. Shamblers can see in darkness up to 90 feet. They are known for their ability to regenerate, healing 1 hit point per round as long as they are in contact with water or damp earth. Shamblers are particularly vulnerable to drought, which causes them to become dormant until water returns. They are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful creatures, who lure them to specific areas with regular watering.
