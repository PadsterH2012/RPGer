Spectres are powerful undead creatures that appear as translucent, humanoid figures. They attack with their touch, which does 1-8 hit points of damage and drains 2 levels of experience from the victim. A victim who loses all levels becomes a spectre under the control of the one that killed them. Spectres can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, electricity, and poison. They can be turned by clerics. Spectres can fly and pass through solid objects (but not magical barriers such as a wall of force). They are found in tombs, ruins, and other desolate places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak the common tongue and several other languages from their mortal life. Spectres are particularly feared for their ability to drain life energy and create more spectres from their victims. They are vulnerable to sunlight, which causes them discomfort but no actual damage. Spectres cast no shadow and have no reflection in mirrors or other reflective surfaces. They are often the spirits of evil humans who have died violent deaths and returned to haunt the living.
