Satyrs, also known as fauns, are woodland creatures with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a goat. They have small horns on their heads and slightly pointed ears. They attack with a butt from their horns, which does 2-8 hit points of damage, or with weapons, usually a dagger or club. They can play magical tunes on their pipes, which can charm, cause fear, or cause sleep in those who hear them unless a saving throw versus magic is made. Satyrs have a natural magic resistance of 50%. They can move silently in woods, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls. Satyrs are found in deep forests, where they live in small groups. They are intelligent and mischievous, and enjoy playing pranks on other creatures. They speak their own language, elvish, and the common tongue. Satyrs are particularly fond of wine, music, and dancing, and will often hold wild revels in forest clearings. They are excellent musicians and can play a variety of instruments. Satyrs are sometimes served by small animals and other woodland creatures, who respect their connection to nature. They are particularly vulnerable to iron, which they find painful to touch. Satyrs are generally peaceful, but will defend their homes fiercely if threatened. They are known for their love of pranks and their ability to charm with their music, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies.
