The gynosphinx is a sphinx with the head of a human female. It attacks with its powerful claws, each of which does 2-8 hit points of damage. It can also cast the following spell-like powers once per day: detect magic, read magic, read languages, detect invisible, locate object, dispel magic, remove curse, legend lore, and symbol. Gynosphinxes are found in deserts and other remote areas, where they guard ancient treasures and sacred sites. They are intelligent and enigmatic, and enjoy posing riddles and puzzles to those who encounter them. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages. Gynosphinxes are particularly fond of riddles and puzzles, and will often challenge travelers to solve them before allowing passage. They are excellent flyers despite their great weight due to their magical nature. Gynosphinxes are sometimes served by other creatures, who respect their wisdom and power. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which slows their movements and reduces their effectiveness in combat. Gynosphinxes are generally neutral in the conflicts between good and evil, preferring to remain isolated in their desert homes.
