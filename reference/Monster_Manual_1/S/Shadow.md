Shadows are undead creatures that appear as dark, shadowy humanoid figures. They attack with their touch, which does 2-5 hit points of damage and drains 1 point of strength from the victim. This strength returns at a rate of 1 point per turn. If a victim's strength is reduced to 0, they become a shadow. Shadows can only be hit by magical weapons of at least +1 enchantment. They are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells. They can be turned by clerics. Shadows are found in dungeons, ruins, and other dark places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak no languages. Shadows are particularly feared for their ability to drain strength and create more shadows from their victims. They are excellent at hiding in dark areas, gaining a +3 bonus to surprise rolls in such environments. Shadows can see in darkness up to 90 feet. They make no noise when moving, which can make them difficult to detect. Shadows are particularly vulnerable to bright light, which they find painful and disorienting. They are often found in groups, as each shadow creates more of its kind from its victims.
