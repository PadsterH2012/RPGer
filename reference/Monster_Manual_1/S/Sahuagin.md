Sahuagin, or sea devils, are aquatic humanoids with green-black scales, webbed hands and feet, and fish-like features. They attack with their claws and bite, and sometimes with weapons such as tridents or spears. If they are underwater, they can also attack with the claws on their feet. They can breathe air for up to 4 hours, but must be immersed in salt water at least once per day or they will die. They can see in darkness up to 120'. Sahuagin are found in oceans and seas, where they build underwater cities. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy raiding coastal settlements for food and slaves. They are enemies of all other aquatic races, especially elves. Sahuagin speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. They are known for their cruelty and their hatred of surface dwellers. Sahuagin are particularly effective in water, where they can use all five of their natural weapons. They are excellent swimmers and can navigate the darkest depths with ease. Sahuagin are sometimes served by sharks, which they can command telepathically. They are particularly vulnerable to fresh water, which causes them pain and discomfort. Sahuagin are generally hostile to all other races, but will sometimes trade with evil surface dwellers for weapons and other items they cannot make themselves.
