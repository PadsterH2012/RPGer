The androsphinx is a sphinx with the head of a human male. It attacks with its powerful claws, each of which does 3-18 hit points of damage. It can also roar three times per day, with each roar having a different effect: the first roar causes fear in all creatures within 12" who fail a saving throw versus magic; the second roar causes all creatures within 12" to be paralyzed for 1-4 rounds unless they save versus magic; the third roar causes all creatures within 12" to lose 2-20 hit points and be deafened for 2-12 rounds unless they save versus magic. Androsphinxes can cast cleric spells as a 6th level cleric. Androsphinxes are found in deserts and other remote areas, where they guard ancient treasures and sacred sites. They are intelligent and noble, and will aid good-aligned beings in need. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages. Androsphinxes are particularly effective against evil creatures, whom they can detect at a distance of up to 9". They are immune to charm and hold spells, and are resistant to fire and lightning. Androsphinxes are sometimes served by good-aligned creatures, who respect their wisdom and power. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which slows their movements and reduces their effectiveness in combat.
