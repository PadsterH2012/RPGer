Salamanders are intelligent creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire. They appear as large, serpentine creatures with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a snake. Their skin is a deep red or orange, and they radiate intense heat. They attack with a spear or other weapon, which does 2-12 hit points of damage plus 1-6 hit points of heat damage, and with their constricting tail, which does 1-6 hit points of damage plus 1-6 hit points of heat damage. If the tail hits, it constricts for an additional 2-12 hit points of damage per round until the victim breaks free. Any creature touching a salamander takes 1-6 hit points of damage from the heat. Salamanders are immune to fire and heat, and take only half damage from cold. They take double damage from cold-based attacks. They can only be hit by magical weapons. Salamanders are found in volcanoes, hot springs, and other areas of intense heat, or on the Elemental Plane of Fire. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and the language of fire elementals. Salamanders are particularly feared for their ability to constrict victims and their intense heat, which can kill even the strongest warrior in seconds. They are excellent metalworkers and often craft powerful weapons and armor. Salamanders are sometimes summoned by evil spellcasters to serve as guardians or warriors.
