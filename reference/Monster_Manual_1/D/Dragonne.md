The dragonne is a powerful creature with the head of a lion and the scales and wings of a brass dragon. It attacks with its claws and bite. It can also roar three times per day, which causes weakness (-2 to hit and damage) in all creatures within 12" who fail a saving throw versus paralyzation. The weakness lasts for 1-6 rounds. The dragonne can fly, but prefers to run. It is territorial and will attack anything that enters its domain. Dragonnes are found in warm hills and mountains, and make their lairs in caves. Dragonnes are solitary creatures that fiercely defend their territory. They are excellent hunters and can track prey for miles. Despite their fearsome appearance and territorial nature, dragonnes are not inherently evil and may occasionally be tamed by powerful individuals. Their roar is particularly feared, as it can weaken even the strongest warriors, making them vulnerable to the dragonne's powerful physical attacks.
