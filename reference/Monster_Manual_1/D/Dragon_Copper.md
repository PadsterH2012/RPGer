Copper dragons are found in dry, rocky regions. They are fond of jokes and pranks. They attack with their claws and bite, and can use two different breath weapons: a line of acid 5' wide and 60' long, or a cloud of slow gas 3' wide, 2' high, and 2' long. The acid does damage equal to the dragon's current hit points, with a saving throw for half damage. The slow gas causes all within it to move and attack at half speed for 1-6 rounds unless they save versus dragon breath. Copper dragons can speak their own language, and at adult age or older they can cast spells as a 1st to 4th level magic-user, depending on their age. They can also stone shape at will, once per day. Copper dragons enjoy playing tricks on travelers but are rarely malicious unless provoked. Copper dragons are witty and clever, and enjoy riddles and wordplay. They are particularly fond of bards and others who appreciate their sense of humor. Copper dragons are known for their ability to climb sheer rock faces with ease and can burrow through stone at a slow rate.
