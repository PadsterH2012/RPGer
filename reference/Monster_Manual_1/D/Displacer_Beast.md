The displacer beast is a strange creature that resembles a large, black panther with six legs and two long, tentacle-like appendages growing from its shoulders. It attacks with these tentacles, each of which does 2-8 hit points of damage. The displacer beast's most notable ability is its displacement, which makes it appear to be 3' away from its actual location. This gives it a -2 bonus to all saving throws and causes all attacks against it to suffer a -2 penalty to hit. The displacer beast is found in forests and hills, where it hunts for prey. It is intelligent enough to use simple tactics, such as ambushing prey or retreating if outmatched. It speaks no languages. The displacer beast is particularly feared for its displacement ability, which makes it difficult to hit in combat. It is excellent at hiding in shadows, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. The displacer beast has excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 90 feet. It is known for its territorial behavior, and will often attack anything that enters its domain. The displacer beast is a natural enemy of blink dogs, and the two species will always fight if they encounter each other. It is particularly vulnerable to true seeing and similar magic, which negates its displacement ability and makes it much easier to hit in combat.
