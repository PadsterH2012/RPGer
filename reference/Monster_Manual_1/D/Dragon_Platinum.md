The Platinum Dragon, Bahamut, is a unique creature, the king of good dragonkind. He appears as a massive platinum-scaled dragon with blue eyes. He attacks with his two front claws and his bite. His bite does 8-80 hit points of damage. He can also breathe a cone of cold 9" long and 3" wide at the base, which does damage equal to his hit points (84 hit points when at full strength), or half that amount if a saving throw is made. He can use this breath weapon once every three rounds.

Bahamut is immune to all forms of attack used by creatures of less than godlike status, except for +5 or better weapons. He is immune to all forms of death magic, and takes half damage from all energy attacks. He regenerates 3 hit points per round. He can use the following spell-like powers at will: detect evil, detect invisible, detect magic, and read languages. He can use the following spell-like powers three times per day: dispel magic, polymorph self, and suggestion. Once per day, he can use the following spell-like powers: anti-magic shell, charm monster, and teleport without error. He can also cast spells as a 20th level magic-user and a 20th level cleric.

Bahamut is found on the Plane of Mount Celestia, where he rules over a layer of the plane. He rarely leaves his lair, but may be summoned to the Material Plane by powerful good magic. He is highly intelligent and wise, and will use all of his powers to great effect in combat. He speaks all languages, and can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet. Bahamut is particularly respected for his combination of physical power, magical abilities, and wisdom, which makes him one of the most formidable allies in existence. He is particularly vulnerable to evil-aligned weapons of +5 or greater enchantment, which ignore his damage resistance. Bahamut is generally benevolent to all good-aligned creatures, and will often aid them in their quests against evil. He is known for his wisdom and his love of justice, which makes him both respected and revered by good beings.
