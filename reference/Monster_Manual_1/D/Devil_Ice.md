Ice devils, also known as Gelugon, appear as tall, insectoid humanoids with a chitinous exoskeleton and a long, barbed tail. They attack with their clawed hands and tail. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: detect invisible objects, detect magic, fear (by gaze), fly, invisibility, know alignment, polymorph self, produce flame, pyrotechnics, wall of ice, and teleport without error. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another ice devil (25% chance of success), a horned devil (45% chance of success), or a bone devil (65% chance of success).

Ice devils are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from gas. They are immune to poison, fire, and cold. They can be hit by +2 or better weapons.

Ice devils are found in the Nine Hells, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are exceptionally intelligent, and are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Ice devils speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Ice devils are particularly feared for their ability to cause fear with their gaze, which can quickly render opponents helpless. They are excellent at ambushing prey, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. Ice devils are sometimes used as advisors by more powerful devils, who value their intelligence and their magical abilities. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Ice devils are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.

The tail of an ice devil injects a poison that causes the victim to feel as if they are freezing from within, causing them to lose 1 point of Dexterity and Constitution per turn for 1-6 turns unless a save versus poison is made.
