Manes are the lowest form of demonkind, also known as sub-demons. They appear as small, bloated humanoids with pale, rubbery flesh, sharp claws, and fangs. They attack with their claws and bite. They have no spell-like abilities.

Manes are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. They are immune to poison and non-magical fire. They can be hit by normal weapons.

Manes are found in the Abyss, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are of semi-intelligence, and are not cunning fighters. They are aggressive and will attack intruders on sight. Manes do not speak any languages.

Manes are particularly feared for their numbers, which can quickly overwhelm opponents. They are used as cannon fodder by more powerful demons, who value their expendability. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Manes are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will never negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their mindless aggression, which makes them dangerous enemies for good beings.

Manes are the souls of evil humans who have been transformed into demons in the Abyss. They are sometimes used as a form of punishment by demon lords, who transform more powerful demons into manes as a form of humiliation. Manes can be promoted to higher forms of demonkind if they prove themselves worthy, but this is rare.
