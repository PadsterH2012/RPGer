Bone devils, also known as Osyluth, appear as tall, skeletal humanoids with a long, barbed tail and insectoid features. They attack with their clawed hands and tail. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: detect invisible objects, detect magic, fear (by gaze), fly, invisibility, produce flame, pyrotechnics, and teleport without error. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another bone devil (40% chance of success) or a barbed devil (60% chance of success).

Bone devils are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold and gas. They are immune to poison and fire. They can be hit by +1 or better weapons.

Bone devils are found in the Nine Hells, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are highly intelligent, and are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Bone devils speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Bone devils are particularly feared for their ability to cause fear with their gaze, which can quickly render opponents helpless. They are excellent at ambushing prey, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. Bone devils are sometimes used as enforcers by more powerful devils, who value their combat abilities and their intelligence. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Bone devils are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.

The tail of a bone devil injects a poison that causes weakness (-2 to hit and -2 to damage) for 2-8 turns unless a save versus poison is made.
