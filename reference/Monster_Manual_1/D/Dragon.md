# DRAGON

Dragons are powerful reptilian creatures that come in many colors, sizes, shapes, and alignments. They are among the most feared and respected creatures in the world. This entry covers general information and common characteristics of all dragons.

## Dragon Types

Dragons are divided into two main categories: chromatic (evil) and metallic (good). There are also two unique dragons: the Chromatic Dragon (Tiamat) and the Platinum Dragon (Bahamut), which are singular individuals with no others of their type.

The ten common species of dragons are detailed in individual entries:

## Dragon Size and Age

Dragons have three general size categories (small, average, and huge) determined by die roll (1d8: 1-2 = small, 3-7 = average, 8 = huge). This size determination indicates the number of hit dice a dragon has.

Dragons pass through eight ages in their lives:
1. Very young - 1-5 years - 1 hit point per die
2. Young - 6-15 years - 2 hit points per die
3. Sub-adult - 16-25 years - 3 hit points per die
4. Young adult - 26-50 years - 4 hit points per die
5. Adult - 51-100 years - 5 hit points per die
6. Old - 101-200 years - 6 hit points per die
7. Very old - 201-400 years - 7 hit points per die
8. Ancient - 401+ years - 8 hit points per die

## Dragon Abilities

All dragons share certain common abilities:

- **Keen Senses**: Dragons see equally well in daylight or darkness (infravision, 60'). They have excellent sight, smell, and hearing, allowing them to detect hidden or invisible creatures within 1" per age level.

- **Fear Aura**: Adult and older dragons radiate a powerful aura that causes fear when they fly overhead or charge:
  1. All creatures under 1 hit die and non-aggressive creatures flee in panic for 4-24 turns.
  2. Creatures with fewer than 3 hit dice must save versus magic or be paralyzed with fear (50%) or panic (50%).
  3. Creatures with 3 or more hit dice fight at -1 on their hit dice unless they save versus magic.
  4. Creatures with 6 or more hit dice automatically disregard the aura.
  5. The aura of adult, old, and very old dragons is less powerful than ancient dragons, giving saving throw bonuses of +5, +3, and +1 respectively.

- **Language and Spells**: Many dragons can speak human languages and use magical spells. The chances vary by dragon type.

- **Breath Weapon**: All dragons have a breath weapon they can use three times per day. The breath weapon causes damage equal to the dragon's current hit points (half with a successful save).

## Combat with Dragons

### Sleeping Dragons
A sleeping dragon is only found in its lair and will awaken upon hearing loud noise within 30'-120', if attacked, or on a roll of 6 on a d6. Attackers get a +3 bonus to hit a sleeping dragon, but this bonus is lost once the dragon awakens.

### Attack Forms
Dragons may be attacked to kill or to subdue. The attack form must be announced before combat begins. Silver, gold, chromatic, and platinum dragons cannot be subdued.

### Weapon Effectiveness
Certain weapons are more or less effective against different dragon types, as shown in the following chart:

| Dragon's Breath | Air | Earth | Fire | Water | Electricity |
|-----------------|-----|-------|------|-------|------------|
| Cold            | -1  | +1    | -1   | +1    |            |
| Acid            | +1  | +1    |      |       |            |
| Gas             | +1  |       |      |       |            |
| Electricity     | +1  | -1    |      | -1    |            |
| Fire            | -1  | +1    | -1   | +1    |            |

- Air includes attacks by aerial servant, air elemental, djinni, invisible stalker, or whirlwind
- Earth includes attacks by earth elemental, xorn, or umber hulk
- Fire includes attacks by efreet, fire elemental, or salamander
- Water includes attacks by triton or water elemental

### Subduing a Dragon
Subdual is accomplished by announcing intent to subdue before combat. All damage is considered non-fatal. The chance of subduing a dragon equals the ratio of subduing damage to the dragon's total hit points, expressed as a percentage. A dragon is automatically subdued when this ratio reaches 100%.

### Multiple Dragons
If two dragons are encountered outside their lair, it will be a mated pair. Three or more will be sub-adults. Mated pairs are always 5th through 8th age categories. Any young in lair are eggs (10%) or very young (90%). When defending their young, dragons gain ferocity bonuses of +2 to hit and +1/+3 in clawing/biting damage.

### Treasure
Dragon treasure varies by age:
- Very young: Usually none (10% chance for 1/4 normal)
- Young: 25% chance for 1/4 normal
- Sub-adult: 50% chance for 1/2 normal
- Young adult to old: Normal treasure
- Very old: 50% chance for 150% normal
- Ancient: 75% chance for 200% normal

### Dragon Weaknesses
Most dragons can be subdued, showing an innate cowardice. Their egoistic nature makes them susceptible to flattery. Greed motivates most dragons (except 40% of silver, 80% of gold, and the platinum dragon), making them manipulable by clever persons or the promise of treasure.

### Dragon Saving Throws
When a dragon attains 5+ hit points per die, its saving throw is calculated by dividing its total hit points by 4. Even very young dragons gain the benefit of their actual hit dice for determining saving throws, reflecting their innate magic resistance and toughness.
