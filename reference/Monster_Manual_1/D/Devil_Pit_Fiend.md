Pit fiends are the most powerful of the common devils, appearing as 12' tall, bat-winged humanoids with scaled skin, large horns, and a long tail. They attack with their claws and bite. Their tail can constrict for 2-12 points of damage per round once it has hit. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: detect invisible objects, detect magic, pyrotechnics, produce flame, suggestion, teleport without error, and wall of fire. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another pit fiend (50% chance of success), symbol of pain, and symbol of stunning.

Pit fiends are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold. They are immune to poison, gas, and fire. They can be hit by +2 or better weapons.

Pit fiends are found in the Nine Hells, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are highly intelligent and cunning, and are excellent strategists. They are aggressive and domineering, and will attempt to control any situation they find themselves in. Pit fiends speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Pit fiends are particularly feared for their combination of physical power, magical abilities, and intelligence, which makes them formidable opponents. They are excellent flyers and can hover in place. Pit fiends are sometimes served by other devils, whom they command with absolute authority. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Pit fiends are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.
