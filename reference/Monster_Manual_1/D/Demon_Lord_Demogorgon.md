Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons, is one of the most powerful demon lords of the Abyss. He appears as a huge, reptilian creature with two mandrill-like heads on long, serpentine necks, and tentacles in place of arms. He attacks with his tentacles and bites. He can use all the spell-like powers of demons at will, plus the following unique powers: cause disease, charm monster, ESP, fear (by gaze), illusion, project image, read languages, read magic, symbol, telekinesis (weight limit 10,000 g.p.), and teleport without error. Once per day, he can use the following spell-like powers: gate in 1-4 Type VI demons (100% chance of success), 1-6 Type V demons (100% chance of success), or any other type of demon (100% chance of success).

Demogorgon is immune to weapons that are not at least +2 or better. He takes half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. He is immune to poison and non-magical fire. He can only be hit by +2 or better weapons.

Demogorgon is found in the Abyss, where he rules over his own layer. He is of supra-genius intelligence, and is a cunning fighter. He is aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Demogorgon speaks all languages.

Demogorgon is particularly feared for his combination of physical power, magical abilities, and intelligence, which makes him a formidable opponent. He is an excellent strategist and will use his powers to great effect in combat. Demogorgon is the ruler of many demons, who fear and respect his power. He is particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Demogorgon is generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. He is known for his cruelty and his love of causing pain, which makes him both an entertaining companion and a dangerous enemy for evil beings.

Demogorgon is constantly at war with other demon lords, particularly Orcus and Graz'zt, for supremacy in the Abyss. His title "Prince of Demons" is contested by many other demon lords, but few can match his power.
