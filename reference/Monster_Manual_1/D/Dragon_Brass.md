Brass dragons are found in deserts and arid regions. They are talkative and friendly. They attack with their claws and bite, and can use two different breath weapons: a cloud of sleep gas 7' wide, 2' high, and 2' long, or a cone of fear gas 7' wide at the base, 2' wide at the end, and 20' long. The sleep gas causes all within it to fall asleep for 1-6 turns unless they save versus dragon breath. The fear gas causes all within it to flee in panic for 1-6 rounds unless they save versus dragon breath. Brass dragons can speak their own language, and at adult age or older they can cast spells as a 1st to 4th level magic-user, depending on their age. They love conversation and will often detain travelers just to talk with them, sometimes using their sleep breath to ensure a captive audience. Brass dragons are curious and sociable, and enjoy learning about other cultures and creatures. They are particularly fond of storytelling and will often exchange tales with travelers. Brass dragons are known for their ability to survive in extreme desert heat and can burrow through sand with ease.
