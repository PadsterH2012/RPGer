These reptiles somewhat resemble a single-horned rhinoceros. Their head and neck is protected by a bone shield (armor class 3) while their skins are very thick - almost plated. They are herbivorous, but they tend to be somewhat aggressive. They will trample smaller creatures in a charge, inflicting 2-16 hit points damage.
