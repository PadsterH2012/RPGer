Succubi are female demons that appear as stunningly beautiful human women, though they have small bat-like wings on their backs. They attack with their claws, but prefer to use their charm and energy drain abilities. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: cause darkness in a 5' radius, charm person, clairaudience, ESP, etherealness (as the oil), polymorph self, suggestion, and teleport without error. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in a Type IV demon (20% chance of success), a Type V demon (15% chance of success), or a Type VI demon (5% chance of success).

Succubi are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. They are immune to poison and non-magical fire. They can be hit by +1 or better weapons.

Succubi are found in the Abyss, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are exceptionally intelligent, and are cunning fighters. They are seductive and manipulative, and will use their charm abilities to control others. Succubi speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Succubi are particularly feared for their ability to drain energy levels with a kiss, which can quickly weaken opponents. They are excellent at seduction, gaining a +4 bonus to charm attempts. Succubi are sometimes used as spies by demon lords, who value their intelligence and their ability to manipulate others. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Succubi are generally hostile to all other creatures, but will often negotiate or show mercy if it serves their purposes. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.

The male counterpart of the succubus is the incubus, which is identical in all respects except appearance.
