Red dragons are found in mountains and hills. They have scales ranging from bright scarlet to deep burgundy, with a ridge of horns along their spine and massive wings. They attack with their claws and bite, and can also use a breath weapon which is a cone of fire 9' wide at the base, 3' wide at the end, and 30' long. The fire does damage equal to the dragon's current hit points, with a saving throw for half damage. Red dragons can speak their own language, and at adult age or older they can cast spells as a 1st to 4th level magic-user, depending on their age. They are immune to fire and can detect invisible creatures within 10'. Red dragons are the most feared of all evil dragons due to their combination of ferocity, cunning, and powerful breath weapon. They are greedy, arrogant, and quick to anger, and consider themselves to be the pinnacle of dragonkind. Red dragons are particularly fond of treasure, especially gold and gems, and will go to great lengths to increase their hoards. They are known for their ability to sense the presence of precious metals and gems, even through solid rock.
