Dogs are particularly loyal to their masters and will often fight to the death to protect them. They are excellent at detecting intruders, gaining a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. Dogs have excellent senses of smell and hearing, allowing them to detect the presence of creatures from a considerable distance. Dogs are known for their ability to track by scent, which makes them valuable companions for hunters and adventurers. They are particularly effective in packs, where they can coordinate their attacks to bring down larger prey.

Wild dogs are sometimes tamed and trained by rangers or druids, who value their hunting skills and their loyalty.
