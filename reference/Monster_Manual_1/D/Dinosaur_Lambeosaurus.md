One of the family of crested herbivorous dinosaurs, this creature is able to see, hear, and smell exceptionally well. They are thus able to detect enemies frequently and flee to safety - either outdistancing the predator or hiding in a swampy area. Other crested dinosaurs include corythosaurus, parasaurolophus, prosaurolophus, and saurolophus.
