Djinn are powerful beings from the Elemental Plane of Air. They appear as tall, noble humanoids with blue-ish skin. They attack with their fists, which do 2-16 hit points of damage. They can also create whirlwinds 10' wide at the base, 30' wide at the top, and 60' tall. These whirlwinds do 2-16 hit points of damage and can sweep away creatures of less than 2 hit dice. Djinn can carry up to 6,000 g.p. weight at normal movement, or up to 12,000 g.p. weight at half movement. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: create food and water, create temporary objects of metal, create permanent objects of wood or cloth, create illusions, invisibility, gaseous form, and wind walk. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: weather control, plane shift, and conjure an elemental from the Elemental Plane of Air. Djinn are found on the Elemental Plane of Air, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are intelligent and generally benevolent, but resent being summoned and bound to service. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages. Djinn are particularly effective against creatures vulnerable to air and wind, such as fire-based creatures. They are excellent flyers and can hover in place. Djinn are sometimes bound to serve mortals, either through magical items such as rings or lamps, or through powerful spells. They are particularly vulnerable to imprisonment in specially prepared vessels, which they cannot escape without outside help.
