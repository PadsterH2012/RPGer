Dopplegangers are shapeshifting creatures that can assume the form of any humanoid creature they have seen. They attack with their fists or with weapons, depending on their current form. They gain a +4 bonus to surprise rolls when disguised. Dopplegangers are immune to sleep and charm spells, and save at +5 versus magic. They can detect the thoughts of other creatures, which allows them to perfectly mimic the behavior and speech of the creatures they impersonate. Dopplegangers are found in dungeons, ruins, and other places where they can prey on unsuspecting victims. They are intelligent and cunning, and will often infiltrate groups of adventurers or settlements to feed on the inhabitants. They speak their own language and can speak any language known by the creature they are impersonating. Dopplegangers are particularly feared for their ability to perfectly mimic other creatures, which makes them excellent spies and assassins. They are excellent at blending into society, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls when disguised. Dopplegangers have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 90 feet. They are known for their ability to infiltrate groups and sow discord, which makes them dangerous enemies. They are particularly vulnerable to true seeing and similar magic, which reveals their true form and makes them much easier to identify.
