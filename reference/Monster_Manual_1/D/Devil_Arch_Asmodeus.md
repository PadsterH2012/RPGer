Asmodeus, the Overlord of all dukes of Hell, is the most powerful arch-devil of the Nine Hells. He appears as a tall, handsome humanoid with dark hair, pale skin, and small horns. He wields a ruby rod of power, which can cause 5-50 points of damage with a touch. He can use all the spell-like powers of devils at will, plus the following unique powers: charm monster, detect invisible objects, detect magic, ESP, fear (by gaze), illusion, know alignment, polymorph self, read languages, read magic, suggestion, telekinesis (weight limit 10,000 g.p.), and teleport without error. Once per day, he can use the following spell-like powers: gate in 1-4 pit fiends (100% chance of success), 1-6 ice devils (100% chance of success), or any other type of devil (100% chance of success), and symbol of pain, fear, or death.

Asmodeus is immune to weapons that are not at least +3 or better. He takes half damage from gas. He is immune to poison, fire, and cold. He can only be hit by +3 or better weapons.

Asmodeus is found in the Nine Hells, where he rules over the ninth layer. He is of supra-genius intelligence, and is a cunning fighter. He is aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Asmodeus speaks all languages.

Asmodeus is particularly feared for his ruby rod, which can cause massive damage with a touch. He is an excellent strategist and will use his powers to great effect in combat. Asmodeus is the ruler of all devils, who fear and respect his power. He is particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Asmodeus is generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. He is known for his cruelty and his love of causing pain, which makes him both an entertaining companion and a dangerous enemy for evil beings.

Asmodeus is constantly at war with the demon lords for supremacy in the Lower Planes. He is particularly hated by Demogorgon, with whom he competes for dominion over evil.
