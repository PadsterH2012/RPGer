Type IV demons, also known as Nalfeshnee or boar-headed demons, appear as large, obese humanoids with the head of a boar and small, functional wings. They attack with their claws and bite. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: cause darkness in a 5' radius, detect invisible objects, detect magic, dispel magic, fear (as the wand), illusion (as the wand), polymorph self, project image, read languages, read magic, telekinesis (weight limit 4,000 g.p.), and teleport without error. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another Type IV demon (20% chance of success), a Type I demon (70% chance of success), a Type II demon (50% chance of success), or a Type III demon (35% chance of success), and symbol of discord, fear, or stunning.

Type IV demons are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. They are immune to poison and non-magical fire. They can be hit by +1 or better weapons.

Type IV demons are found in the Abyss, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are highly intelligent, and are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Type IV demons speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Type IV demons are particularly feared for their combination of physical power, magical abilities, and intelligence, which makes them formidable opponents. They are excellent strategists and will use their powers to great effect in combat. Type IV demons are sometimes used as advisors by more powerful demons, who value their intelligence and their magical abilities. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Type IV demons are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.
