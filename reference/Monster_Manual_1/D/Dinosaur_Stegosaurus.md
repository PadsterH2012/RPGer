Another of the ornithischians, the stegosaurus, or "plated lizard," is a large, very stupid herbivorous dinosaur with aggressive defenses. It thrives nearly anywhere and is often found in Jurassic-like plains or jungles. Its great plates allow the creature to defend 90% of the time at armor class 2. Its spiked tail, with four or more boney spikes of one to over two feet in length, has its own brain; and the stegosaurus turns its rear continually towards an enemy, while tucking its head low. If anything near it seems threatening, it will react in this manner.
