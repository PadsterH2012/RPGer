# DEMON

Demons come in many colors, sizes, shapes, and alignments. Two sorts of demons (the Chromatic Dragon and the Platinum Dragon) are singular individuals, and there are no others of their type. Each demon sort will be treated individually hereafter. General information and common characteristics will be given here.

The ten species of demons have three general size categories (small, average, and huge) according to the size typical of each. This categorization is determined by die roll. An 8-sided die is rolled: 1-2 = small, 3-7 = average, 8 = huge. This size determination indicates the number of hit dice a demon has.

Demons pass through eight ages in their lives. These growth stages are:
1. Very young - 1-5 years - 1 hit point per die
2. Young - 6-15 years - 2 hit point per die
3. Sub-adult - 16-25 years - 3 hit point per die
4. Young adult - 26-50 years - 4 hit point per die
5. Adult - 51-100 years - 5 hit point per die
6. Old - 101-200 years - 6 hit point per die
7. Very old - 201-400 years - 7 hit point per die
8. Ancient - 401+ years - 8 hit point per die

To determine the age (and thus the number of hit points per die a demon has) simply roll an 8-sided die, the number rolled indicating the age as shown above.

All demons see equally well in daylight or darkness (infravision, 60'). They have excellent sight, smell, and hearing. Because of these keen senses, all demons are able to detect hidden or invisible creatures within 1" per age level. Demons also develop the power to panic enemies as they mature. At adult age and older they radiate a powerful aura which causes a fear reaction, when a demon flies overhead or charges, as follows:

1. All creatures under 1 hit die, as well as non-carnivorous creatures of any sort which are not trained for warfare or basically not fearless or aggressive will flee in panic. Such rout will be made at fastest speed possible, and it will continue for 4-24 turns.
2. Creatures with fewer than 3 hit dice must save versus magic or be paralyzed with fear (50%) or panic as above (50%).
3. Creatures with 3 or more hit dice will fight at a penalty of -1 on their hit dice unless they also save versus magic.
4. Creatures with 6 or more hit dice automatically disregard the aura affect.
5. The aura of adult, old, and very old demons is not as powerful as that of ancient demons, so saving throws applicable to their auras are at +5, +3, and +1 respectively. Thus, a 2nd level fighter, normally having to score 16 (75%) or better to save against magic (the demon's aura in this case), would gain a bonus of 5 on his saving throw versus an adult demon's aura; so any score of 11 or more would save him from panic.

A considerable percentage of demons have the ability to speak one or more human languages in addition to the language of their species. Similarly, a fair number of demons which can speak are able to employ magical spells. The chances for either of these abilities occurring in any given individual demon are shown under the specific treatment by species. The chance that any given demon will be asleep will likewise be so given.

Sleeping Demon: A sleeping demon is only found in its lair, and it will always awaken upon hearing loud noise such as talking, shouting, forcing a door, etc. if it is within 30' to 120' (depending on baffling factors; walls, doors, etc.) and the volume of sound. It will awaken if attacked. It will also awaken on a roll of 6 on a 6-sided die. If a sleeping demon is attacked, its opponents get a bonus of +3 to strike it, but as soon as the demon is awake, the bonus is lost.

Attacking a Demon: Demons may be attacked two ways: to kill or to subdue. The attack form must be announced prior to combat or it will automatically take the killing form. Once selected, attack form cannot be changed with respect to any given demon.

Certain weapons will be more or less effective than others against the various types of demons. This is indicated on the following chart, the number indicating the addition or subtraction for the probability of hitting as well as the amount of damage done.

Attack by:
Dragon's Breath | Air* | Earth** | Fire*** | Water**** | Electricity | Cold
---------------|-----|--------|--------|----------|------------|------
                | -1   | +1     | -1     | +1       |            |
Acid           | +1   | +1     |        |          |            |
Gas            | +1   |        |        |          |            |
Electricity    | +1   | -1     | -1     |          |            |
Fire           | -1   | +1     | -1     | +1       |            |
Multiple types |      |        |        |          |            |

* Includes attack by aerial servant, air elemental, djinni, invisible stalker, or "whirlwind"
** Includes attack by earth elemental, xorn, or umber hulk
*** Includes attack by efreet, fire elemental, or salamander
**** Includes attack by triton or water elemental

Demons can attack by claw/bite or breath weapon. The latter can be used but three times per day, maximum. If a choice is possible roll percentile dice. Any score above 50% indicates the demon will breathe. The breath weapon causes damage equal to the demon's hit points (half that amount if a saving throw is made) on each and every creature hit by the breath weapon. Cone shaped breath weapons are 1/2" diameter at point of origin.

Subduing a Demon: An attack on a demon to subdue, and thus capture it may be opted for if such intent is announced in advance of combat. Silver, gold, chromatic, and platinum demons cannot be subdued. Note that it is impossible for creatures with less than average intelligence to attack to subdue. Subdual is accomplished as follows:

Upon announcement of intent to strike to subdue, all hit points of damage scored by attacks upon the demon are considered non-fatal battering/bruising damage. The total number of hit points scored each melee round is stated as a ratio; hit points scored are ratioed over the number of hit points the demon has, and this ratio is converted to a percentage chance; this percentage chance is the chance that the demon will be subdued by the hit points of subduing damage it has received at the end of any given melee round. This percentage could be 0%, 1%, 35%, 99% or whatever.

Percentile dice are then rolled, and if the number they show is equal to or less than the percentage ratio the demon is subdued. It is always subdued when the ratio of subduing damage to hit points equals or exceeds 1:1 (100% or greater).

A maximum of one human-sized attacker per 3 linear feet of exposed demon (excluding tail) is possible. Thus, a demon with a 15' long body, fully exposed, would offer opportunity for a maximum of 11 humans to attack it (5 per flank plus one at its head).

Example of Subduing a Demon: Two 8th level fighters, a 7th level dwarven fighter, an elven 4th level fighter/6th level magic-user, and a halfling thief of 9th level stumble upon a huge red demon peacefully asleep upon a veritable mountain of treasure. After a hurried, whispered debate the party opts to strike to subdue as that will a) give them a demon to use or sell, b) save treasure from destruction by avoiding the fireworks of a general melee, and c) the subdued demon will have to point out and help carry out the choicest treasure items. The smaller, quiet party members circle the demon. None stand at the beast's head. With a shout the party strikes with a general bonus of +3 to hit. They all succeed, and the halfling thief gains quadruple damage bonus of striking from behind! They score a total of 44 hit points of subduing damage. The first melee round is over. As the demon is ancient, it has 8 hit points per die, as it is huge it has 11 dice, for a total of 88 hit points. The referee rolls percentile dice, any score of 1% to 50% indicates subdual; a 61% is rolled. Combat goes to round two. As the demon has just awakened, the party again strikes first. Four of them hit, and another 23 hit points subduing damage is scored. The demon chooses to breathe (dice score 99%), so he turns his head and fires right where the elf, dwarf and halfling are attacking. Saving throws indicate that each takes 44, 88, and 44 hit points damage respectively. All three char and die. The round is over, and the referee ratios 67 over 88 - 76% is the chance for subdual, but a 92 is rolled. The demon fights on. Initiative dice are rolled, the demon wins, decides to bite, and scores a hit doing 23 hit points of damage to the second 8th level fighter. The two fighters strike, one hits, and the demon takes another 10 hit points of subdual. The third round is over, and the chance for the demon being subdued is 77:88 (7/8) or 87.5% (treat as 88%). The referee rolls an 89. The fighters win initiative, strike, and score 12 hit points, so the demon is subdued automatically before it can attack. The garnering of loot now begins.

Value of a Subdued Demon: Larger towns and cities will usually have a market for demons. If a demon is sold, it usually goes out of the game, although the referee may wish to assign it to some one of his special non-playing characters whom he runs for encounter in the town/city. The selling price of a subdued demon ranges from 100 to 800 gold pieces per hit point. This price is subject to adjustment by the referee. Offers are typically determined by rolling an 8-sided die. Subdued demons can be ridden.

Length of Subdual: A demon remains subdued for an indefinite period, but if the creature is not strongly held, well treated, given ample treasure, and allowed ample freedom, it will seek to kill its captor and/or escape. The older and more powerful the demon, the less the likelihood of it remaining subdued. Likewise, an intelligent, spell-using demon is not likely to remain subdued. In fact, the latter sort of demon is likely to attempt to take over its captor and rule his holdings. Evil demons will never serve a good master for long, and good demons are 50% more likely to kill/escape from a neutral captor as opposed to one whose alignment is the same as their own. Players may always opt to sell or give a demon to any other player or keep the monster in their own service. Note that demons cannot be re-subdued unless they actually regain their freedom.

Encountering Multiple Demons: If two or more demons are encountered outside their lair it will be a mated pair if two are encountered and sub-adults if three or more are encountered. If two or more demons are encountered in their lair it will be a mated pair - with their young if applicable. Mated pairs are always 5th through 8th age categories. Any young in lair are eggs (10%) or very young (90%). If young demons are attacked both adults will automatically breathe and then melee to bite, gaining a ferocity bonus of +2 to hit and +1/+3 in clawing/biting damage. If either of the mated pair is attacked the other demon will rush to its defense, gaining the ferocity bonuses stated above, unless it is attacked simultaneously.

Treasure: Very young demons will usually have no treasure, but there is a 10% chance that they will have one-quarter the possible listed treasure. Young demons have 25% chance for one-quarter the possible listed treasure. Sub-adults have a 50% chance for one-half the possible listed treasure. Young adults, and old demons have normal treasure. Very old and ancient demons are 50% and 75% likely to have 150% and 200% respectively of the listed treasure.

Weaknesses of Demons: The innate cowardice of demonkind is shown by the fact most can be subdued. Demons' egoistic nature makes them subject to flattery, and it also makes the more stupid of them prone to attack other powerful creatures whom they view as disputing their dominating position. Greed and avarice are major motivating factors in all but the loftiest of demons (40% of silver, 80% of gold, and the platinum demon), so they are subject to manipulation by very clever persons or the prospect of actual treasure and the promise of more forthcoming.

Demon Saving Throws: When a demon attains 5 or more hit points per die, its saving throw is calculated by dividing its total hit points by 4, thus giving a higher number of hit dice than it actually has. This reflects the magic resistance and general toughness of this creature. Conversely, even a very young demon gains the benefit of the actual number of its hit dice, even though the hit points/die are but 1 each, for determining scores required. This reflects the same nature of demonkind, i.e. magic resistance and toughness.
