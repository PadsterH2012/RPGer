Type V demons, also known as Marilith or snake-bodied demons, appear as beautiful female humanoids from the waist up, with the lower body of a giant snake. They have six arms, each typically wielding a weapon. They attack with their six weapons and their constricting tail. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: cause darkness in a 5' radius, detect invisible objects, detect magic, dispel magic, fear (as the wand), polymorph self, project image, pyrotechnics, read languages, read magic, telekinesis (weight limit 5,000 g.p.), and teleport without error. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another Type V demon (15% chance of success), a Type I demon (80% chance of success), a Type II demon (60% chance of success), a Type III demon (40% chance of success), or a Type IV demon (25% chance of success).

Type V demons are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. They are immune to poison and non-magical fire. They can be hit by +1 or better weapons.

Type V demons are found in the Abyss, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are highly intelligent, and are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Type V demons speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Type V demons are particularly feared for their combination of physical power, magical abilities, and intelligence, which makes them formidable opponents. They are excellent strategists and will use their powers to great effect in combat. Type V demons are sometimes used as generals by demon lords, who value their intelligence and their combat abilities. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Type V demons are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.
