Barbed devils, also known as Hamatula, appear as tall, thin humanoids covered in sharp, barbed spines. They attack with their clawed hands and tail. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: detect invisible objects, detect magic, hold person, produce flame, pyrotechnics, and teleport without error. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another barbed devil (50% chance of success) or a bone devil (25% chance of success).

Barbed devils are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold and gas. They are immune to poison and fire. They can be hit by +1 or better weapons.

Barbed devils are found in the Nine Hells, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are very intelligent, and are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Barbed devils speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Barbed devils are particularly feared for their ability to produce flame, which can quickly set opponents on fire. They are excellent at ambushing prey, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. Barbed devils are sometimes used as guards by more powerful devils, who value their combat abilities and their loyalty. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Barbed devils are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.

Anyone striking a barbed devil with a hand-held weapon (or natural weapons) will take 2-8 points of damage from the devil's barbs.
