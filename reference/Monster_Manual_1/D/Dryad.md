Dryads are beautiful female tree spirits. Each dryad is mystically bound to a single oak tree, and cannot go more than 36" from it. If forced to do so, she will die within 1-6 turns. Dryads can step into their oak trees, effectively becoming invisible and intangible. They can charm person at will, and any male who fails his saving throw will follow the dryad to her tree and disappear inside it with her, never to be seen again. Dryads speak their own language, elvish, and the common tongue. They are shy and reclusive, but will sometimes help those who are respectful of the forest. Dryads can communicate with plants and animals in their vicinity and often have woodland creatures as allies. Dryads are intelligent and can cast various woodland spells. They are protectors of their forests and will use their charm ability to lure away those who threaten their homes. They are particularly fond of music and dancing, and may occasionally join in the revels of elves or other woodland beings. Dryads are immortal as long as their trees survive, and they will do everything in their power to protect their oak trees from harm.
