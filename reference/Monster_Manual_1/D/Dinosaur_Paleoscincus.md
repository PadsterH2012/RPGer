These reptiles are veritable "walking dreadnoughts," for their heavy plated skin, sharp side spines, and spiked tail make them nearly invulnerable to attack. A predator trying to bite one is likely to inflict 3-12 hit points damage upon itself if it scores a hit! Of course, the paleocincus will be lashing its thorny tail to drive off its attacker. These creatures are sometimes aggressive if intruded upon.
