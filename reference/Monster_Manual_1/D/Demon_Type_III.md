Type III demons, also known as Glabrezu or dog-headed demons, appear as large, powerful humanoids with a dog-like head and two pairs of arms - one pair ending in powerful pincers, the other in clawed hands. They attack with their claws, pincers, and bite. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: cause darkness in a 5' radius, detect invisible objects, detect magic, dispel magic, fear (as the wand), polymorph self, pyrotechnics, telekinesis (weight limit 3,000 g.p.), and teleport without error. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another Type III demon (25% chance of success), a Type I demon (60% chance of success), or a Type II demon (40% chance of success).

Type III demons are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. They are immune to poison and non-magical fire. They can be hit by +1 or better weapons.

Type III demons are found in the Abyss, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are very intelligent, and are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Type III demons speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Type III demons are particularly feared for their combination of physical power, magical abilities, and intelligence, which makes them formidable opponents. They are excellent strategists and will use their powers to great effect in combat. Type III demons are sometimes used as commanders by more powerful demons, who value their intelligence and their ability to lead lesser demons. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Type III demons are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.
