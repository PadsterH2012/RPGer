Silver dragons are found in mountains and clouds. They are friendly toward humans and often take human form to interact with them. They attack with their claws and bite, and can use two different breath weapons: a cone of cold 8' wide at the base, 2Â½' wide at the end, and 27' long, or a cloud of paralyzation gas 5' wide, 4' high, and 6' long. The cold does damage equal to the dragon's current hit points, with a saving throw for half damage. The gas paralyzes all within it for 1-6 rounds unless they save versus dragon breath. Silver dragons can speak their own language, and at adult age or older they can cast spells as a 1st to 4th level magic-user, depending on their age. They can also polymorph themselves into any animal or humanoid form at will, three times per day. Silver dragons are known to walk among humans in disguise for years, forming friendships and even falling in love with them. Silver dragons are the most sociable of all dragons and genuinely enjoy the company of humans and other races. They often establish identities in human communities and may live there for decades. Silver dragons are known for their ability to fly through the most severe weather conditions without difficulty and can walk on clouds as if they were solid.
