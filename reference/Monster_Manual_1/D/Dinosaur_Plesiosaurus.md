The plesiosaurus strongly resembles a snake wearing a turtle's body (sans shell). They tend to be very aggressive and attack anything. The creature's neck is about one-third of its total length, and it is strong and fast. In a marine battle it can strike with its powerful fore flippers for 2-12 points of damage with each.
