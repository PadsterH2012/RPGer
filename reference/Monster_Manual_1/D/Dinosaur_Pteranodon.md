Although these flying reptiles typically dive for marine prey, they will attack any creature which appears to be vulnerable. They have no teeth but spear victims with their beaks if they are too large to swallow at a gulp. The beak of a typical pteranodon is about 4' long. The creature weighs only 40 or 50 pounds, but they can carry off prey four times their own weight.
