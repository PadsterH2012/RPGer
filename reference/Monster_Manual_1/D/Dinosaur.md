# DINOSAUR

Dinosaurs are reptiles, their name being derived from the Greek "terrible lizard," descended from a variety of the species called thecodonts. The two orders of dinosaurs are saurischians and ornisthischians. All carnivorous dinosaurs fall into the former order. All armored and/or horned dinosaurs fall into the latter order.

Because of the nature of time in planes where magic works, dinosaurs widely separate in time are discussed hereunder, for they can be found intermingled on some alternate world, strange plane, or isolated continent somewhere.

It must be borne in mind that all of these reptiles are extremely stupid. Their motivation is primarily hunger. The predatory types are both ferocious and voracious. The herbivorous dinosaurs are likewise insatiable eaters, but they tend to either ignore all non-eatable things which do not appear to threaten them or flee in panic from anything which they view as dangerous. Certain plant eaters, however, are aggressive in their defense, and these sorts are dangerous, notably stegosaurs, ankylosaurs, and ceratopsians.

Marine dinosaurs might overturn vessels to get at the "food" aboard, or they might snatch unsuspecting creatures from the decks of passing ships. Land carnivores will pursue anything that looks or smells edible, only ceasing pursuit when the prey has obviously moved completely out of their grasp. Herbivorous dinosaur herds might stampede in virtually any direction, as long as it is away from one of the big meat-eaters. Any creature directly in the path of such a stampede will be carried along or killed - the latter if smaller, slower, and weaker.
