Orcus, the Prince of the Undead, is a powerful demon lord of the Abyss. He appears as a massive, corpulent humanoid with the head of a goat, bat-like wings, and cloven hooves. He wields a wand of death, which can slay any living creature with a touch. He attacks with his wand and his fists. He can use all the spell-like powers of demons at will, plus the following unique powers: animate dead, cause disease, charm monster, ESP, fear, illusion, project image, read languages, read magic, symbol, telekinesis (weight limit 7,500 g.p.), and teleport without error. Once per day, he can use the following spell-like powers: gate in 1-3 Type VI demons (95% chance of success), 1-5 Type V demons (95% chance of success), or any other type of demon (95% chance of success).

Orcus is immune to weapons that are not at least +2 or better. He takes half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. He is immune to poison and non-magical fire. He can only be hit by +2 or better weapons.

Orcus is found in the Abyss, where he rules over his own layer. He is of genius intelligence, and is a cunning fighter. He is aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Orcus speaks all languages.

Orcus is particularly feared for his wand of death, which can instantly slay opponents. He is an excellent strategist and will use his powers to great effect in combat. Orcus is the ruler of all undead, who fear and respect his power. He is particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Orcus is generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. He is known for his cruelty and his love of causing pain, which makes him both an entertaining companion and a dangerous enemy for evil beings.

Orcus is constantly at war with other demon lords for supremacy in the Abyss. He is particularly hated by Demogorgon, with whom he competes for the title "Prince of Demons".
