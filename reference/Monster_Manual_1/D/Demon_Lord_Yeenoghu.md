Yeenoghu, the Demon Lord of Gnolls, is a powerful demon lord of the Abyss. He appears as a tall, gaunt humanoid with a hyena-like head, wielding a triple-headed flail. He attacks with his flail, which can stun, paralyze, or cause wounds that will not heal naturally. He can use all the spell-like powers of demons at will, plus the following unique powers: cause disease, charm monster, ESP, fear, illusion, project image, read languages, read magic, symbol, telekinesis (weight limit 5,000 g.p.), and teleport without error. Once per day, he can use the following spell-like powers: gate in 1-2 Type VI demons (85% chance of success), 1-4 Type V demons (85% chance of success), or any other type of demon (85% chance of success).

Yeenoghu is immune to weapons that are not at least +2 or better. He takes half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. He is immune to poison and non-magical fire. He can only be hit by +2 or better weapons.

Yeenoghu is found in the Abyss, where he rules over his own layer. He is of high intelligence, and is a cunning fighter. He is aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Yeenoghu speaks all languages.

Yeenoghu is particularly feared for his flail, which can cause wounds that will not heal naturally. He is an excellent strategist and will use his powers to great effect in combat. Yeenoghu is the ruler of all gnolls, who fear and respect his power. He is particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Yeenoghu is generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. He is known for his cruelty and his love of causing pain, which makes him both an entertaining companion and a dangerous enemy for evil beings.

Yeenoghu is constantly at war with other demon lords for supremacy in the Abyss. He is particularly hated by Baphomet, the Horned King, with whom he competes for dominion over bestial races.
