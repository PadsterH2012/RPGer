Lemures are the lowest form of devilkind, representing the form of the dead in the Nine Hells. They appear as vaguely humanoid blobs of molten flesh with distorted facial features. They attack with their claws. They have no spell-like abilities.

Lemures are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold and gas. They are immune to poison and fire. They can be hit by normal weapons.

Lemures are found in the Nine Hells, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are of semi-intelligence, and are not cunning fighters. They are aggressive and will attack intruders on sight. Lemures do not speak any languages.

Lemures are particularly feared for their numbers, which can quickly overwhelm opponents. They are used as cannon fodder by more powerful devils, who value their expendability. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Lemures are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will never negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their mindless aggression, which makes them dangerous enemies for good beings.

Lemures are the souls of evil humans who have been transformed into devils in the Nine Hells. They are sometimes used as a form of punishment by arch-devils, who transform more powerful devils into lemures as a form of humiliation. Lemures can be promoted to higher forms of devilkind if they prove themselves worthy, but this is rare.
