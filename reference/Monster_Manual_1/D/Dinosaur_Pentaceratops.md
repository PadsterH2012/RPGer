This is another of the quadrupedal dinosaurs of the ornithischian order; it is a relative of monoclonius, styracosaurus, and triceratops. It is an aggressive but plant-eating creature. Its shield and horns give its head armor class 2, while its body is armor class 6. If it charges it will trample smaller creatures for 2-20 hit points.
