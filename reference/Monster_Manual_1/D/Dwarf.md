Dwarves are short, stocky demihumans with long beards and a dour disposition. They are skilled miners, metalworkers, and fighters. They have infravision to 60', and can detect sloping passages, traps, shifting walls, and new construction on a 1-4 on a d6. They gain a +1 bonus to hit orcs, half-orcs, goblins, and hobgoblins, and a -4 bonus to saving throws against magic and poison. They are resistant to magic, gaining a +1 bonus to saving throws for every 3Â½ points of Constitution. Dwarves typically live in mountainous regions, where they build elaborate underground cities. They are excellent craftsmen, especially with metal and stone. They are long-lived, with a lifespan of 350 years or more. Dwarves speak their own language, gnome, goblin, kobold, orc, and the common tongue. Dwarves are known for their stubbornness, practicality, and loyalty. They have a strong sense of honor and will always keep their word. They are particularly fond of gold and gems, and are skilled at assessing the value of precious metals and stones. Dwarves have a natural enmity toward goblins, orcs, and other evil humanoids, and will often go out of their way to fight these creatures.
