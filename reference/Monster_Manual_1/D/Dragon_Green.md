Green dragons are found in forests and jungles. They have scales ranging from dull forest green to brilliant emerald, with a ridge of horns along their spine. They attack with their claws and bite, and can also use a breath weapon which is a cloud of chlorine gas 5' wide, 4' high, and 6' long. The gas does damage equal to the dragon's current hit points, with a saving throw for half damage. Green dragons can speak their own language, and at adult age or older they can cast spells as a 1st to 4th level magic-user, depending on their age. They are immune to poison and can breathe water as well as air. Green dragons are cunning and treacherous, and enjoy manipulating other creatures. They are skilled at deception and often use their abilities to trick and confuse their enemies. Green dragons are excellent ambush predators and can use the dense forest foliage to hide their presence. They are known for their ability to blend into forest terrain, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls in such environments.
