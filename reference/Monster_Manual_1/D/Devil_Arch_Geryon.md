Geryon, the "Wild Beast", is a powerful arch-devil of the Nine Hells. He appears as a muscular humanoid with the lower body of a serpent, large wings, and a bull's head. He attacks with his clawed hands and his powerful tail. He can use all the spell-like powers of devils at will, plus the following unique powers: charm monster, detect invisible objects, detect magic, ESP, fear (by gaze), illusion, know alignment, polymorph self, read languages, read magic, suggestion, telekinesis (weight limit 5,000 g.p.), and teleport without error. Once per day, he can use the following spell-like powers: gate in 1-2 pit fiends (80% chance of success), 1-4 ice devils (80% chance of success), or any other type of devil (80% chance of success), and symbol of pain or fear.

Geryon is immune to weapons that are not at least +2 or better. He takes half damage from gas. He is immune to poison, fire, and cold. He can only be hit by +2 or better weapons.

Geryon is found in the Nine Hells, where he rules over the fifth layer. He is of exceptional intelligence, and is a cunning fighter. He is aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Geryon speaks all languages.

Geryon is particularly feared for his powerful tail, which can constrict opponents for 3-18 points of damage per round. He is an excellent strategist and will use his powers to great effect in combat. Geryon is the ruler of many devils, who fear and respect his power. He is particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Geryon is generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. He is known for his cruelty and his love of causing pain, which makes him both an entertaining companion and a dangerous enemy for evil beings.

Geryon is constantly at war with other arch-devils for supremacy in the Nine Hells. He is particularly hated by Dispater, with whom he competes for dominion over the middle layers of Hell.
