Bronze dragons are found near coastlines and in deep waters. They are serious and honorable. They attack with their claws and bite, and can use two different breath weapons: a bolt of lightning 5' wide and 100' long, or a repulsion gas cloud 3' wide, 2' high, and 2' long. The lightning does damage equal to the dragon's current hit points, with a saving throw for half damage. The repulsion gas pushes all within it 3" away from the dragon unless they save versus dragon breath. Bronze dragons can speak their own language, and at adult age or older they can cast spells as a 1st to 4th level magic-user, depending on their age. They can also polymorph themselves into any animal or humanoid form at will, three times per day. Bronze dragons can breathe water as well as air and often make their lairs in underwater caves with above-water entrances. Bronze dragons are protectors of the innocent and enemies of evil. They are particularly fond of humans and will often take human form to interact with them. Bronze dragons are known for their sense of justice and will go to great lengths to right wrongs and punish evildoers.
