Type I demons, also known as Vrocks or vulture demons, appear as tall, gaunt humanoids with the head and legs of a vulture. They attack with their taloned hands, feet, and beak. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: cause darkness in a 5' radius, detect invisible objects, detect magic, telekinesis (weight limit 2,000 g.p.), teleport without error, and cause fear (as the wand). Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another Type I demon (35% chance of success), and create an ear-splitting screech that stuns all within 3" for 1-3 rounds unless a saving throw versus paralyzation is made.

Type I demons are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. They are immune to poison and non-magical fire. They can be hit by +1 or better weapons.

Type I demons are found in the Abyss, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Type I demons speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Type I demons are particularly feared for their ability to stun with their screech, which can render entire groups of adventurers helpless. They are excellent flyers and can hover in place. Type I demons are sometimes used as shock troops by more powerful demons, who value their ferocity and their ability to fly. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Type I demons are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.
