White dragons are found in cold, arctic regions. They are the smallest and least intelligent of the chromatic dragons. They attack with their claws and bite, and can use a breath weapon which is a cone of cold 7' wide at the base, 2' wide at the end, and 25' long. The cold does damage equal to the dragon's current hit points, with a saving throw for half damage. White dragons can speak, and at adult age or older they can cast spells as a 1st to 4th level magic-user, depending on their age. They are immune to cold and can move across ice and snow without penalty or reduced movement rate. White dragons are savage and animalistic, relying more on instinct than intellect. They are territorial and will attack anything that enters their domain. White dragons are particularly fond of frozen meat, and will often freeze their prey before eating it. They are known for their ability to burrow through snow and ice, often creating elaborate tunnel systems beneath the surface of glaciers.
