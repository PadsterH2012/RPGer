The Chromatic Dragon, Tiamat, is a unique creature, the queen of evil dragonkind. She appears as a massive five-headed dragon, with each head representing one of the five types of evil dragons: black, blue, green, red, and white. She attacks with all five heads, each of which can bite for 2-20 hit points of damage, and her tail, which does 3-30 hit points of damage. Each head can also breathe once per turn, with the breath weapon corresponding to the dragon type: acid (black), lightning (blue), chlorine gas (green), fire (red), and cold (white). Each breath weapon does damage equal to Tiamat's hit points (64 hit points when at full strength), or half that amount if a saving throw is made.

Tiamat is immune to all forms of attack used by creatures of less than godlike status, except for +5 or better weapons. She is immune to all forms of death magic, and takes half damage from all energy attacks. She regenerates 2 hit points per round. She can use the following spell-like powers at will: darkness 15' radius, detect invisible, detect magic, and read languages. She can use the following spell-like powers three times per day: dispel magic, polymorph self, and suggestion. Once per day, she can use the following spell-like powers: anti-magic shell, charm monster, and teleport without error.

Tiamat is found in the Nine Hells, where she rules over a layer of the plane. She rarely leaves her lair, but may be summoned to the Material Plane by powerful evil magic. She is highly intelligent and cunning, and will use all of her powers to great effect in combat. She speaks all languages, and can communicate telepathically with any creature within 100 feet. Tiamat is particularly feared for her combination of physical power, magical abilities, and intelligence, which makes her one of the most formidable opponents in existence. She is particularly vulnerable to good-aligned weapons of +5 or greater enchantment, which ignore her damage resistance. Tiamat is generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. She is known for her cruelty and her love of causing pain, which makes her both feared and respected by evil beings.
