Black dragons are found in swamps and marshes. They have glossy black scales and a distinctive skull shape with a forward-swept horn. They attack with their claws and bite, and can also use a breath weapon which is a stream of acid 5' wide and 60' long. The acid does damage equal to the dragon's current hit points, with a saving throw for half damage. Black dragons can speak their own language, and at adult age or older they can cast spells as a 1st to 4th level magic-user, depending on their age. They are immune to acid and can breathe water as well as air. Black dragons are cruel and malicious, and enjoy tormenting their victims before killing them. They are particularly fond of ambushing their prey from the murky waters of their swamp homes. Black dragons are excellent swimmers and can move through water at their full movement rate. They are known for their ability to hide in swampy terrain, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls in such environments.
