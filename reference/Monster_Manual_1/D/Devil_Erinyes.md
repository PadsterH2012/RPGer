Erinyes appear as beautiful human women with large, feathered wings. They attack with a rope of entanglement and a sword. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: detect invisible objects, detect magic, fear (by gaze), invisibility, know alignment, locate object, polymorph self, produce flame, pyrotechnics, and teleport without error. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another erinyes (30% chance of success) or a barbed devil (20% chance of success).

Erinyes are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold and gas. They are immune to poison and fire. They can be hit by +1 or better weapons.

Erinyes are found in the Nine Hells, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are highly intelligent, and are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Erinyes speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Erinyes are particularly feared for their ability to cause fear with their gaze, which can quickly render opponents helpless. They are excellent at ambushing prey, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. Erinyes are sometimes used as messengers by more powerful devils, who value their intelligence and their ability to fly. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Erinyes are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.

The rope of entanglement used by an erinyes can entangle a target up to 30' away, and the target must save versus magic or be unable to move or attack until freed.
