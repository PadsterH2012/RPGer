Juiblex, the Faceless Lord, is a powerful demon lord of the Abyss. He appears as a massive, amorphous blob of black, green, and purple slime, with glaring red eyes that appear and disappear across his form. He attacks by engulfing his opponents. He can use all the spell-like powers of demons at will, plus the following unique powers: cause disease, charm monster, ESP, fear, illusion, project image, read languages, read magic, symbol, telekinesis (weight limit 5,000 g.p.), and teleport without error. Once per day, he can use the following spell-like powers: gate in 1-2 Type VI demons (90% chance of success), 1-4 Type V demons (90% chance of success), or any other type of demon (90% chance of success).

Juiblex is immune to weapons that are not at least +2 or better. He takes half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. He is immune to poison and non-magical fire. He can only be hit by +2 or better weapons.

Juiblex is found in the Abyss, where he rules over his own layer. He is of exceptional intelligence, and is a cunning fighter. He is aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Juiblex speaks all languages.

Juiblex is particularly feared for his ability to engulf opponents, which can quickly dissolve them. He is an excellent strategist and will use his powers to great effect in combat. Juiblex is the ruler of all slimes, jellies, and oozes, who fear and respect his power. He is particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Juiblex is generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. He is known for his cruelty and his love of causing pain, which makes him both an entertaining companion and a dangerous enemy for evil beings.

Juiblex is constantly at war with other demon lords for supremacy in the Abyss. He is particularly hated by Zuggtmoy, the Demoness Lady of Fungi, with whom he competes for dominion over decay and rot.
