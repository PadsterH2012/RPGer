An aggressive plant-eater, styracosaurus tends to charge at anything which appears threatening. The boney plate gives the head area an armor class of 2, and there is a 50% chance that anything attempting to bite its rear portions will be stabbed by one or more of the sharp frills of the head plate, each frill inflicting 1-6 hit points of damage, 1-3 frills possibly striking. If it charges it will trample smaller creatures and do 2-16 hit points of damage.
