The thunder-lizard is a 40 ton plant-eater found near marshes and lakes. The creature spends much of his time in shallow water to support his bulk. It moves to deep water to avoid carnivores. Apatosaurus ignores small things, but it is prone to step on anything in its way (doing 4-40 points of damage).
