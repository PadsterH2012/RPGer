Type II demons, also known as Hezrou or toad demons, appear as large, toad-like humanoids with long, powerful arms. They attack with their claws and bite. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: cause darkness in a 5' radius, detect invisible objects, detect magic, fear (as the wand), levitate, polymorph self, and telekinesis (weight limit 2,000 g.p.). Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another Type II demon (30% chance of success) or a Type I demon (70% chance of success).

Type II demons are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold, electricity, and gas. They are immune to poison and non-magical fire. They can be hit by +1 or better weapons.

Type II demons are found in the Abyss, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are of average intelligence, and are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Type II demons speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Type II demons are particularly feared for their ability to cause fear, which can render entire groups of adventurers helpless. They are excellent at hiding in shadows, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. Type II demons are sometimes used as shock troops by more powerful demons, who value their ferocity and their ability to cause fear. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Type II demons are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.
