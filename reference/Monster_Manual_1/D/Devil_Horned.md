Horned devils, also known as Malebranche, appear as tall, muscular humanoids with horns, a barbed tail, and leathery wings. They attack with their clawed hands and tail. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: detect invisible objects, detect magic, fear (by gaze), hold person, invisibility, produce flame, pyrotechnics, and teleport without error. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: gate in another horned devil (30% chance of success), a bone devil (50% chance of success), or a barbed devil (70% chance of success).

Horned devils are immune to weapons that are not magical or made of silver. They take half damage from cold and gas. They are immune to poison and fire. They can be hit by +2 or better weapons.

Horned devils are found in the Nine Hells, or summoned to the Material Plane by powerful spellcasters. They are highly intelligent, and are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Horned devils speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages.

Horned devils are particularly feared for their ability to cause fear with their gaze, which can quickly render opponents helpless. They are excellent at ambushing prey, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. Horned devils are sometimes used as commanders by more powerful devils, who value their intelligence and their combat abilities. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Horned devils are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are known for their cruelty and their love of causing pain, which makes them both entertaining companions and dangerous enemies for evil beings.

The tail of a horned devil injects a poison that causes the victim to feel as if they are burning from within, causing them to lose 1 point of Strength and Constitution per turn for 1-6 turns unless a save versus poison is made.
