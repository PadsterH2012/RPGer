The dragon turtle is a huge aquatic creature with the body of a turtle and the head of a dragon. It attacks with its clawed flippers and bite. It can also use a breath weapon which is a cloud of steam 5' wide, 4' high, and 6' long. The steam does damage equal to the dragon turtle's current hit points, with a saving throw for half damage. The dragon turtle can use its breath weapon three times per day. It can also swallow whole any creature of man-size or smaller on a natural 20 attack roll with its bite. Swallowed creatures take 3-18 hit points of damage per round from digestive acids, and will die after 6 rounds. The dragon turtle is found in deep waters, and will sometimes attack ships that enter its territory, demanding tribute in the form of treasure. Dragon turtles can remain submerged indefinitely and are excellent swimmers despite their massive size. Dragon turtles are intelligent and can speak the common tongue and several other languages. They are not inherently evil, but are greedy and territorial. They often collect treasure from shipwrecks and may demand payment from ships passing through their territory. Their shells are incredibly tough and can withstand tremendous pressure, allowing them to dive to extreme depths.
