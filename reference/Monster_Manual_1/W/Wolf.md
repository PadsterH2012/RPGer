Wolves are carnivorous mammals that resemble large, powerful dogs. They attack with their bite, which does 2-5 hit points of damage. Wolves are found in forests, hills, and plains, where they hunt in packs. They are not aggressive toward humans unless starving or provoked, but will defend themselves if threatened. Wolves have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can track prey for miles. Wolves are known for their pack tactics, which allow them to take down prey much larger than themselves. They are particularly effective in winter, when deep snow hampers the movement of their prey. Wolves are sometimes trained by humanoids to serve as hunting beasts and guards. Their pelts are valued for making warm clothing, and a single wolf pelt can be worth up to 5 gold pieces. Wolves are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage.

**Dire Wolf**:
AC: 6; Move: 18"; HD: 3+3; Damage: 2-8; Size: M (4' at shoulder)

Dire wolves are larger, more aggressive cousins of normal wolves. They attack with their powerful bite, which does 2-8 hit points of damage. Dire wolves are found in forests, hills, and mountains, where they hunt in small packs. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Dire wolves have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 90 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can track prey for miles. Dire wolves are particularly feared for their size and strength, which makes them capable of bringing down even the largest prey. They are sometimes used as mounts by goblins, orcs, and other evil humanoids. Dire wolves are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely show mercy. They are particularly fond of human flesh, and will often target humans over other prey.
