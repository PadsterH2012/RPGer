Wyverns are dragon-like creatures with two legs, two wings, and a long tail tipped with a venomous stinger. They attack with their bite, which does 2-16 hit points of damage, and their stinger, which does 1-6 hit points of damage and injects a poison that kills the victim unless a saving throw versus poison is made. Wyverns are found in mountains and forests, where they build nests on high, inaccessible ledges. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning hunters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Wyverns speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. Wyverns are particularly feared for their poisonous stinger, which can kill even the strongest warrior in seconds. They are excellent flyers and can hover in place. Wyverns are sometimes captured and trained as mounts by powerful beings, though this is extremely dangerous due to their aggressive nature and their poisonous stinger. Wyvern eggs and young are highly valued, with a single egg worth up to 3,000 gold pieces. Wyverns have excellent eyesight and can spot movement from miles away. They are particularly protective of their nesting grounds and will attack any creature that threatens their young.
