Wraiths are powerful undead creatures that appear as dark, shadowy humanoid figures. They attack with their touch, which does 1-6 hit points of damage and drains 1 level of experience from the victim. A victim who loses all levels becomes a wraith under the control of the one that killed them. Wraiths can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, electricity, and poison. They can be turned by clerics. Wraiths can fly and pass through solid objects (but not magical barriers such as a wall of force). They are found in tombs, ruins, and other desolate places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak the common tongue and several other languages from their mortal life. Wraiths are particularly feared for their ability to drain life energy and create more wraiths from their victims. They are vulnerable to sunlight, which they find painful but not deadly. Wraiths cast no shadow and have no reflection in mirrors or other reflective surfaces. They are often the spirits of evil humans who have died and returned to haunt the living. Wraiths are particularly effective at night, when their ability to see in darkness gives them an advantage over most prey.
