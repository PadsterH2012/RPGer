Wights are undead creatures that appear as pale, gaunt humanoids with sunken eyes and withered flesh. They attack with their touch, which does 1-4 hit points of damage and drains 1 level of experience from the victim. A victim who loses all levels becomes a wight under the control of the one that killed them. Wights can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, electricity, and poison. They can be turned by clerics. Wights are found in tombs, ruins, and other desolate places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak the common tongue and several other languages from their mortal life. Wights are particularly feared for their ability to drain life energy and create more wights from their victims. They are vulnerable to sunlight, which they find painful but not deadly. Wights cast no shadow and have no reflection in mirrors or other reflective surfaces. They are often the spirits of evil humans who have died and returned to haunt the living. Wights are particularly effective at night, when their ability to see in darkness gives them an advantage over most prey.
