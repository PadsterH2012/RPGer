They attack with a powerful electrical discharge, which does 2-16 hit points of damage. Will o' wisps are nearly impossible to hit, with an armor class of -8. They are immune to all spells except magic missile, protection from evil, and maze. They can be hit only by magical weapons. Will o' wisps are found in swamps, marshes, and other desolate places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy luring travelers to their doom. They speak the common tongue and several other languages. Will o' wisps are particularly feared for their ability to change their appearance and lure victims into dangerous areas, such as quicksand or monster lairs. They feed on the life energy of dying creatures, and will often work to ensure that their victims meet a slow, painful end. Will o' wisps are excellent at hiding, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls. They are particularly effective at night, when their glowing appearance can be mistaken for lanterns or other harmless lights. Will o' wisps are generally hostile to all other creatures, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are particularly fond of fear and despair, and will often torment their victims before killing them.
