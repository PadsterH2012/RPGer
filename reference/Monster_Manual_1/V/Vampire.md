Vampires are powerful undead creatures that feed on the blood of the living. They attack with their touch, which does 1-10 hit points of damage and drains 2 levels of experience from the victim. A victim who loses all levels becomes a vampire under the control of the one that killed them. Vampires can also charm with their gaze, which affects any creature that meets their eyes unless a saving throw versus magic is made. Vampires can only be hit by magical weapons. They are immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, electricity, and poison. They can be turned by clerics. Vampires can assume gaseous form at will, and can transform into a bat or wolf. They can summon 10-100 rats, 5-20 bats, or 3-18 wolves. They regenerate 3 hit points per round. Vampires are vulnerable to sunlight, which does 10 hit points of damage per round and forces them to assume gaseous form. They cannot cross running water except at bridges or while in their coffins. They are repelled by garlic, mirrors, and holy symbols. They must rest in their coffins during the day. To permanently destroy a vampire, it must be reduced to 0 hit points, then its coffin must be destroyed and its body exposed to sunlight or immersed in running water. Vampires are found in tombs, ruins, and other desolate places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak the common tongue and several other languages from their mortal life.
