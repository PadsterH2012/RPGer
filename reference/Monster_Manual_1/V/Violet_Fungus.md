Violet fungi are mushroom-like plants which grow in dark, damp places underground. They are often found in the company of shriekers. They attack with 1-4 branches which extend up to 4' and secrete a flesh-rotting substance. This substance does 1-4 hit points of damage per round for 8 rounds unless a cure disease spell is used. Violet fungi are immobile, but can wave their branches around to attack anything that comes within reach. They are not intelligent, and will attack anything that comes near them. Violet fungi feed on organic matter, particularly the rotting flesh of their victims. They reproduce by releasing spores which can grow into new fungi within a few days in suitable conditions. Violet fungi are immune to mind-affecting spells due to their lack of intelligence. Despite their simple nature, violet fungi are one of the most feared dungeon hazards due to their ability to cause rotting flesh with their touch. They are particularly dangerous when found in the company of shriekers, as the noise from the shriekers can attract victims to within reach of the violet fungi's branches.
