The remorhaz is a huge, worm-like creature with multiple legs and a heavily armored body. It has a ridge of blue-white, super-heated nodules along its back. It attacks with its huge maw, which does 6-36 hit points of damage. If it scores a natural 20 on its attack roll, it swallows its victim whole. Swallowed creatures take 10-60 hit points of damage per round from the intense heat inside the remorhaz, and will die after 1 round. Any creature touching the remorhaz's back takes 10-60 hit points of damage from the heat. The remorhaz's head and legs are AC 0, while its body is AC 4. The remorhaz is found in arctic regions, where it burrows through ice and snow. It is not intelligent, and relies on instinct to hunt and survive. It is particularly dangerous because of the intense heat it generates, which can melt even the strongest metals. The remorhaz is immune to cold and fire, and is resistant to lightning. It is particularly vulnerable to attacks on its less armored body, which clever adventurers can target to defeat it more quickly. The remorhaz is sometimes hunted for its valuable nodules, which retain their heat for several days after the creature's death and can be used in the creation of magical items related to fire.
