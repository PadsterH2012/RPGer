Rakshasas are evil spirits encased in flesh. They appear as humanoids with the heads of tigers and black, pupilless eyes. Their hands are reversed, with the palms facing outward. They attack with their claws and bite. They can cast spells as a 7th level magic-user and a 7th level cleric. They can also create illusions at will, which are indistinguishable from reality unless a saving throw versus magic is made. Rakshasas can only be hit by weapons of at least +3 enchantment. They are immune to all spells below 8th level. They are vulnerable to blessed crossbow bolts, which kill them instantly. Rakshasas are found in warm regions, where they live in luxurious dwellings. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak the common tongue and several other languages. Rakshasas are particularly feared for their combination of physical power, magical abilities, and illusion powers, which makes them formidable opponents. They are excellent strategists and will use their powers to great effect in combat. Rakshasas are sometimes served by other evil creatures, whom they control through fear and magic. They are particularly fond of eating the flesh of humans, which they consider a delicacy.
