The rust monster is a strange creature with a squat, armored body, four legs, and two long antennae. It does not attack physically, but instead touches metal objects with its antennae, causing them to instantly rust and crumble. This affects even magical metal items, though they receive a saving throw. The rust monster can smell metal at a distance of 9", and will always move toward the largest source of metal it can detect. Rust monsters are found in dungeons and caves, where they feed on metal deposits and the equipment of adventurers. They are not aggressive, and will generally ignore creatures that have no metal. They are particularly feared by heavily armored fighters, who can lose their expensive armor and weapons in seconds. Rust monsters have excellent senses of smell and can detect metal through walls and doors. They are known for their ability to destroy metal, which makes them valuable to some creatures who use them to dispose of unwanted metal items. Rust monsters are sometimes used as guardians by creatures who do not use metal equipment, as they are effective against most adventurers. They are particularly vulnerable to wooden or stone weapons, which they cannot affect with their rusting ability.
