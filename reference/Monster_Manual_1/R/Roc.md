Rocs are enormous birds of prey with wingspans of up to 60 feet. They attack with their talons and beak. When diving on prey from at least 100' up, they gain a +4 bonus to hit and do double damage with their talons. Rocs are found in remote mountains, where they build enormous nests on inaccessible peaks. They are not intelligent, but are cunning hunters. They are particularly dangerous because of their size and strength, which allows them to carry off creatures as large as elephants. Rocs are sometimes captured and trained by giants or other powerful beings to serve as mounts. This is an extremely difficult and dangerous process, but a trained roc is a powerful ally. Roc eggs and young are highly valued, with a single egg worth up to 10,000 gold pieces. Rocs have excellent eyesight and can spot movement from miles away. They are particularly protective of their nesting grounds and will attack any creature that threatens their young. Rocs are sometimes hunted for their feathers, which are used in the creation of magical items related to flight and air. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage.
