Rats are small, rodent scavengers found in urban and wilderness areas. They attack in swarms, with every 5 rats doing 1 hit point of damage. They have a 5% chance of carrying a disease, which infects the victim unless a saving throw versus poison is made. The disease causes the victim to be bedridden for 1-4 weeks, and has a 25% chance of being fatal. Rats are found in dungeons, sewers, and other dark, damp places. They are not aggressive unless cornered or starving, but will defend themselves if threatened. They are excellent swimmers and climbers, and can squeeze through openings as small as 1 inch in diameter. Rats have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can detect food from great distances. Rats are known for their ability to reproduce quickly, with a single pair able to produce hundreds of offspring in a year. They are particularly dangerous in large groups, as they can overwhelm even the largest creatures with their numbers. Rats are sometimes used as familiars by evil spellcasters, who value their stealth and ability to access small spaces.
