The xorn is a strange creature from the Elemental Plane of Earth. It appears as a roughly spherical body with three equally spaced legs, three equally spaced arms, and three equally spaced eyes surrounding a large mouth on top of its body. It attacks with its three claws and its large mouth. It can move through solid rock as easily as humans move through air, leaving no tunnel or hole. It can blend into stone, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls. Xorn are immune to fire and cold. They can only be hit by magical weapons. Xorn are found underground, where they feed on precious metals and gems. They are intelligent and generally neutral, neither helping nor harming other creatures unless provoked. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and the language of earth elementals. Xorn are particularly fond of precious metals and gems, and will often demand these as payment for safe passage through their territory. They can smell precious metals and gems at a distance of up to 20 feet. Xorn are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful beings, who pay them with regular feedings of precious metals and gems. They are particularly vulnerable to electricity, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage. Xorn are generally peaceful, but will defend themselves fiercely if threatened.
