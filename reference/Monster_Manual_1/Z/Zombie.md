Zombies are animated corpses of the dead, created by evil wizards or clerics to serve as guardians or soldiers. They attack with their fists or with weapons, usually clubs or other simple weapons. They always strike last in a combat round, regardless of initiative. They are immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells, as well as to cold-based attacks and poison. They can be turned by clerics. Zombies are not intelligent, and follow the simple instructions of their creator. They are found in dungeons, ruins, and graveyards, where they guard treasures or patrol endlessly. Zombies can see in the dark and are not affected by light-based spells. They make no noise when moving, which can make them difficult to detect. Zombies do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and can function indefinitely unless destroyed. They are often used as expendable troops by evil spellcasters, as they require no maintenance and follow orders without question. Zombies can be created from the corpses of any humanoid creature, though human zombies are the most common. Unlike skeletons, zombies retain some of their flesh, which gives them a horrifying, decayed appearance. They move slowly and awkwardly, but are relentless in pursuing their prey.
