Zygoms are strange, fungoid creatures that resemble large, puffball mushrooms. They attack by extruding a pseudopod, which does 1-8 hit points of damage and secretes an acid that does an additional 1-8 hit points of damage per round for 3 rounds unless washed off with water. Zygoms can detect vibrations through the ground up to 60 feet away, allowing them to sense the approach of potential prey. Zygoms are found in dungeons, caves, and other dark, damp places. They are not intelligent, and rely on instinct to hunt and survive. They are particularly dangerous because they are often mistaken for harmless fungi until it is too late. Zygoms can move slowly by extending and contracting their pseudopods, but they generally remain in one place for long periods. Zygoms reproduce by releasing spores, which can grow into new zygoms within a few days in suitable conditions. They are immune to mind-affecting spells due to their lack of intelligence. Despite their simple nature, zygoms are feared by dungeon dwellers due to their acidic secretions, which can dissolve flesh and equipment. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they have no special defense against.
