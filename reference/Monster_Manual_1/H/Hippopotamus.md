Hippopotamuses are large, semi-aquatic mammals with barrel-shaped bodies, short legs, and enormous mouths. They attack with their powerful bite, which does 2-20 hit points of damage. They are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to 5 minutes. Hippopotamuses are found in rivers, lakes, and swamps in warm regions. They are not aggressive unless threatened, but will defend their territory and young fiercely. They are particularly dangerous in water, where they can move with surprising speed and agility. Hippopotamuses are herbivores, feeding on grass and other vegetation. They spend most of the day in water to keep cool, and emerge at night to feed. They are social animals, living in groups of 10-30 individuals led by a dominant male. Hippopotamuses are known for their aggressive territorial behavior, and are responsible for more human deaths in Africa than any other large animal. Their hide is thick and tough, providing excellent protection against attacks. Hippopotamuses are sometimes hunted for their meat, hide, and ivory tusks, which are highly valued in some cultures.
