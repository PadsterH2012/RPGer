Horses are large, hoofed mammals that are often used as mounts and beasts of burden. They attack with their hooves, each of which does 1-4 hit points of damage. Horses are found in plains and grasslands, where they graze on vegetation. They are social animals, living in herds led by a dominant stallion. They are not aggressive unless threatened, but will defend themselves and their young if necessary. Horses are intelligent for animals and can be trained to perform various tasks. They are particularly valued for their speed and endurance, which makes them excellent mounts for travel and combat. There are several types of horses:

**Draft Horse**:
AC: 7; Move: 12"; HD: 3; Damage: 1-6/1-6; Size: L (6' at shoulder)

Draft horses are large, powerful horses bred for pulling heavy loads. They are not as fast as other horses, but are much stronger. They are often used to pull wagons, plows, and other heavy equipment.

**Light War Horse**:
AC: 7; Move: 24"; HD: 2; Damage: 1-4/1-4; Size: L (5' at shoulder)

Light war horses are trained for combat, but are not as heavily armored as heavy war horses. They are fast and agile, and are often used by scouts and light cavalry.

**Medium War Horse**:
AC: 7; Move: 18"; HD: 2+2; Damage: 1-6/1-6; Size: L (5Â½' at shoulder)

Medium war horses are a balance between light and heavy war horses. They are reasonably fast and strong, and are the most common type of war horse.

**Heavy War Horse**:
AC: 7; Move: 15"; HD: 3+3; Damage: 1-8/1-8; Size: L (6' at shoulder)

Heavy war horses are large, powerful horses trained for combat. They are not as fast as other horses, but are much stronger and can carry heavily armored knights. They are often armored themselves, which can improve their armor class.

**Riding Horse**:
AC: 7; Move: 24"; HD: 2; Damage: 1-4/1-4; Size: L (5' at shoulder)

Riding horses are bred for speed and endurance. They are not trained for combat, but are excellent mounts for travel. They are the most common type of horse.
