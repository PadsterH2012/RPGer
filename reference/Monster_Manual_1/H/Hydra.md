The hydra is a reptilian monster with multiple heads. The number of heads determines the hydra's hit dice, with each head having 1 hit die. Each head can attack independently, biting for 1-10 hit points of damage. To kill a hydra, all of its heads must be destroyed. Each head has hit points equal to the hydra's total hit points divided by the number of heads. When a head is reduced to 0 hit points, it is severed and can no longer attack. Hydras are found in swamps, marshes, and underground caverns. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning fighters. They are particularly dangerous because of their multiple attacks, which can overwhelm even the most skilled warrior. There are several special types of hydra:

**Pyrohydra**:
The pyrohydra has 7-12 heads, each of which can breathe fire in a cone 10' long and 3' wide at the base. The fire does 1-8 hit points of damage per head (save for half damage). The pyrohydra is immune to fire.

**Cryohydra**:
The cryohydra has 7-12 heads, each of which can breathe cold in a cone 10' long and 3' wide at the base. The cold does 1-8 hit points of damage per head (save for half damage). The cryohydra is immune to cold.

**Lernaean Hydra**:
The Lernaean hydra has 5-9 heads. When a head is severed, two new heads grow in its place the following round unless the neck stump is cauterized with fire. The Lernaean hydra is particularly feared for its ability to regenerate heads, which can make it nearly impossible to kill without the use of fire.
