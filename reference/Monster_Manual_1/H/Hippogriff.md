Hippogriffs are magical beasts with the forequarters of an eagle and the hindquarters of a horse. They attack with their eagle claws and horse-like bite. They are excellent flyers and can carry up to 250 pounds in flight. Hippogriffs are found in temperate hills and mountains, where they build nests on high, inaccessible ledges. They are intelligent enough to be trained, but are aggressive and territorial in the wild. They have a particular hatred for pegasi, and the two species will always fight if they encounter each other. Hippogriffs mate for life and typically produce clutches of 1-3 eggs which both parents help to raise. Hippogriffs are sometimes captured and trained as mounts by humans and other humanoids. This is a difficult and dangerous process, but a trained hippogriff is a loyal and powerful ally. Hippogriff eggs and young are highly valued, with a single egg worth up to 2,000 gold pieces. Hippogriffs have excellent eyesight and can spot movement from miles away. They are particularly protective of their nesting grounds and will attack any creature that threatens their young.
