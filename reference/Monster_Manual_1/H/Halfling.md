Halflings are small, humanoid creatures with curly hair, ruddy complexions, and slightly pointed ears. They attack with various weapons, usually slings, short swords, or daggers. They gain a +3 bonus to saving throws against poison, rods, staves, wands, and spells. They are excellent at hiding, with a 90% chance to hide in outdoor settings and a 75% chance to hide in dungeons or underground. They gain a +1 bonus to hit with thrown weapons and slings. Halflings typically live in small villages in hills and meadows, where they build comfortable burrows or small houses. They are excellent farmers and craftsmen, and enjoy good food, drink, and comfort. They are long-lived, with a lifespan of 150 years or more. Halflings speak their own language, gnome, dwarf, elf, goblin, orc, and the common tongue. Halflings are known for their love of peace and quiet, and their aversion to adventure and danger. They are generally friendly toward other good-aligned races, but are wary of larger folk. They are particularly skilled at moving quietly and hiding, making them excellent scouts and thieves. Halflings have a natural resistance to magic, which helps protect them from the many dangers of the world. They are also known for their incredible luck, which seems to help them avoid danger and survive situations that would kill other creatures.
