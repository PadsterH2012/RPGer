The homunculus is a small, humanoid creature created by a wizard to serve as a companion and helper. It appears as a miniature version of its creator, with bat-like wings, a long tail, and sharp teeth. It attacks with its bite, which does 1-3 hit points of damage and injects a sleep poison. Victims must save versus poison or fall asleep for 1-6 turns. The homunculus is immune to all attacks that also affect its creator, and any damage done to the homunculus is also done to its creator. If the homunculus is killed, its creator takes 2-20 hit points of damage. The homunculus is telepathically linked to its creator and can communicate with him at any distance. It can see in darkness and detect invisible creatures within 6". The homunculus is created by a wizard of at least 7th level. The process requires a pint of the wizard's blood, rare herbs and minerals worth at least 1,000 gold pieces, and the casting of mending, mirror image, and wizard eye. The homunculus is then animated by an elemental spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. Homunculi are particularly useful as spies and messengers, as they can fly and are telepathically linked to their creators. They are also effective guardians, as their sleep poison can incapacitate intruders without killing them.
