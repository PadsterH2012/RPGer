Hippocampi are aquatic creatures with the forequarters of a horse and the hindquarters of a fish. They attack with their hooves, which do 1-6 hit points of damage. They are excellent swimmers and can carry riders underwater. They can breathe both air and water. Hippocampi are found in oceans and seas, where they live in small herds. They are not aggressive, but will defend themselves if threatened. They are sometimes trained by aquatic elves, tritons, and other underwater races to serve as mounts. Hippocampi speak their own language and can communicate with horses and other equines. They are known for their speed and agility in water, and can outswim most aquatic predators. Hippocampi are particularly valued by underwater races for their ability to carry riders, as they can transport non-aquatic creatures underwater without the need for water breathing magic. They are intelligent enough to understand simple commands and can be trained to perform various tasks. Hippocampi are herbivores, feeding on seaweed and other aquatic plants. They are particularly vulnerable to creatures that can move both on land and in water, as they are helpless when out of water.
