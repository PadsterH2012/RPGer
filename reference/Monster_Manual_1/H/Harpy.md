Harpies are foul creatures with the upper body of a human female and the lower body and wings of a vulture. They attack with their clawed hands and bite. Their most feared attack, however, is their singing, which charms all within 30" who fail a saving throw versus magic. Charmed victims move toward the harpies, resisting all efforts to restrain them, and stand helplessly while the harpies attack. The charm lasts until dispelled or until the harpy dies. Harpies are found in ruins, caves, and other desolate places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. Harpies are particularly feared for their ability to charm victims with their singing, which can lure even the strongest warrior to his doom. They are filthy creatures, never bathing or grooming themselves, and their nests are foul-smelling places filled with the remains of their victims. Harpies are sometimes served by charmed humanoids, whom they keep as slaves and eventually eat when they tire of them. They are particularly fond of human flesh, and will go to great lengths to capture and devour humans.
