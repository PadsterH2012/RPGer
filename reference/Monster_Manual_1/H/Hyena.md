Hyenas are carnivorous mammals that resemble dogs with sloping backs and powerful jaws. They attack with their bite, which does 2-8 hit points of damage. Hyenas are found in plains, savannas, and deserts, where they hunt in packs. They are scavengers, but are also skilled hunters. They are not aggressive toward humans unless starving or provoked, but will defend themselves if threatened. Hyenas have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can track prey for miles. Hyenas are known for their distinctive laughing call, which they use to communicate with other pack members. They are particularly effective at hunting in groups, using their numbers to overwhelm larger prey. Hyenas are sometimes trained by gnolls and other humanoids to serve as hunting beasts and guards. Their powerful jaws can crush bones, allowing them to extract marrow and other nutrients that other predators cannot access.
