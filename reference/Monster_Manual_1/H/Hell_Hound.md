Hell hounds are fire-breathing canines from the lower planes. They appear as large, muscular dogs with rust-red or coal-black fur, and glowing red eyes. They attack with their powerful bite, which does 1-10 hit points of damage. They can also breathe fire in a cone 5' long and 2' wide at the base, which does damage equal to their hit points (save for half damage). They can use this breath weapon once every 2 rounds. Hell hounds are immune to fire and heat. They have infravision to 60' and can detect invisible creatures within 60'. Hell hounds are found in hot, fiery regions, or serving evil beings as guardians. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy hunting and killing other creatures. They speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. Hell hounds are particularly feared for their ability to breathe fire, which can devastate entire groups of adventurers. They are excellent trackers and can follow a scent trail for miles. Hell hounds are sometimes summoned by evil spellcasters to serve as guardians or hunting beasts. They are particularly effective against creatures vulnerable to fire, such as trolls and other regenerating monsters.
