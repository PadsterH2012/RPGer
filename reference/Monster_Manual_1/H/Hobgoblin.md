Hobgoblins are larger, stronger cousins of goblins. They have hairy, orange-red to red-brown skin, and red or orange eyes. They attack with various weapons, usually spears, swords, or bows. They have infravision to 60'. They are disciplined and militaristic, and prefer to attack in organized groups. They live in tribes in hills, mountains, and underground. They are often led by more powerful individuals, such as hobgoblin kings or chieftains. They are enemies of most other races, especially elves and dwarves. Hobgoblins speak their own language, goblin, and the common tongue. They are skilled in the use of weapons and tactics, and often serve as mercenaries or soldiers for more powerful evil beings. Hobgoblins are known for their discipline and organization, which sets them apart from their chaotic goblin cousins. They are particularly effective in large groups, where their training and coordination make them formidable opponents. Hobgoblins have a strict hierarchical society, with rank determined by strength, cunning, and military skill. They are particularly fond of enslaving other creatures to serve them, and often keep goblins, orcs, or humans as slaves.
