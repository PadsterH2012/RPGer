Herd animals live in all climes - musk oxen and reindeer at the North Pole, giraffe and antelopes at the equator. The smallest will have but 1 hit die, the largest will have 5. Attacks are simply a matter of the animals' in question modes of defense (horns, butting, hooves, flight). Damage is a factor of defense (attack) mode and size/strength. As herd animals are not aggressive, they will stampede away from what they perceive to be the greatest threat to their safety. Humans or humanoids of about man-size or less, will be trampled to death if caught in the path of a stampede.
