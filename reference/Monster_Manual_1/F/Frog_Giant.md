Giant frogs are larger versions of normal frogs. They attack with their powerful bite. They can also use their long, sticky tongues to grab prey up to 15' away. If the tongue hits, the victim is pulled to the frog's mouth and automatically bitten on the next round. Giant frogs can leap up to 30' forward or 15' upward. They are excellent swimmers and can breathe underwater. Giant frogs are found in swamps, marshes, and other wet areas. They are not intelligent, and will attack anything that comes within reach. They are particularly fond of insects, small animals, and humanoids of halfling size or smaller. Giant frogs come in various sizes, with the largest being able to swallow a halfling whole. They are often used as guardians by lizard men, bullywugs, and other swamp-dwelling humanoids. Giant frogs are particularly dangerous in groups, as they can surround and overwhelm larger prey. Their ability to hide in water and ambush passing creatures makes them a common hazard in swampy regions.
