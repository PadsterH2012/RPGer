Fish are aquatic vertebrates that inhabit oceans, lakes, and rivers. They are divided into several types, each with its own unique characteristics and abilities. Fish are found in all types of water bodies, from shallow streams to the deepest oceans. They are not aggressive unless threatened, but will defend themselves if necessary. Fish are particularly vulnerable to predators such as larger fish, aquatic mammals, and birds of prey. They are excellent at detecting vibrations in the water, gaining a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. Fish have excellent vision and can detect movement from a considerable distance. Fish are known for their schooling behavior, which provides protection against predators. They are particularly effective in water, where they can move with great speed and agility. Fish are sometimes captured and kept as pets or for food. Their meat is a staple food source for many cultures, and their scales, bones, and other parts can be used to make tools, decorations, and other items. Fish are particularly vulnerable to pollution and habitat destruction, which can cause entire populations to die off. Fish are generally peaceful, but some species can be aggressive, especially during breeding season or when defending their territory.
