Flightless birds are large, ostrich-like birds that cannot fly but are very fast runners. They attack with their clawed feet and sharp beaks. They are found in plains and savannas, where they feed on insects, small animals, and plants. They are not aggressive, but will defend themselves if threatened. Flightless birds are excellent runners, able to maintain speeds of up to 30 miles per hour for extended periods. They are often hunted for their meat, feathers, and eggs. Flightless birds are social animals, living in small flocks led by a dominant male. They communicate with each other through a variety of calls and displays. Their eggs are large, weighing up to 3 pounds each, and are considered a delicacy in many cultures. Flightless birds are particularly vulnerable to predators that can match their speed, such as large cats and wolves.
