Mind flayers, or illithids, are humanoid creatures with octopus-like heads. They attack with their four tentacles, each of which does 2 hit points of damage. If a tentacle hits, it attaches to the victim's head. If all four tentacles attach, the mind flayer can extract the victim's brain, killing them instantly. Mind flayers can also emit a mind blast in a cone 6" long and 2" wide at the base. All within this area must save versus magic or be stunned for 3-12 rounds. Mind flayers have a natural magic resistance of 90%. They can see in darkness up to 90'. Mind flayers are found deep underground, where they build cities populated by slaves and thralls. They are highly intelligent and malevolent, and consider themselves superior to all other races. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. Mind flayers are particularly feared for their ability to extract and consume brains, which they need to survive. They are often served by intellect devourers, brain golems, and other psionic creatures. Mind flayers are vulnerable to bright light, which causes them discomfort but no actual damage. They are particularly opposed to githyanki and githzerai, two races that once escaped from mind flayer enslavement and now seek to destroy their former masters.
