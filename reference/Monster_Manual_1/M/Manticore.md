The manticore is a monstrous creature with the body of a lion, the face of a human, and the tail of a scorpion. It attacks with its claws and bite, and can also fire 1-6 spikes from its tail each round, up to a maximum of 24 spikes per day. These spikes have a range of 18" and do 1-6 hit points of damage each. The manticore can fire these spikes while flying. Manticores are found in hills and mountains, where they hunt for human prey. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak the common tongue and their own language. Manticores are particularly feared for their ability to fire spikes from a distance, which can devastate entire groups of adventurers before they can close to melee range. They are excellent flyers and can hover in place while firing their spikes. Manticores are sometimes served by other evil creatures, who respect their power and ferocity. They are particularly fond of human flesh, and will go to great lengths to capture and devour humans.
