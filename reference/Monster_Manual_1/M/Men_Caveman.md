Cavemen and tribesmen are primitive humans who live in isolated or inhospitable regions, such as deep forests, mountains, or other wilderness areas. They have not developed advanced technology or social structures, and they rely on hunting, gathering, and simple agriculture for survival. Cavemen are organized into tribes or clans, each led by a chief who is typically a fighter of 4th to 7th level. For every 30 cavemen, there will be a sub-chief who is a fighter of 2nd to 5th level. Caveman tribes may also include shamans or witch doctors who serve as spiritual leaders and advisors.

Cavemen typically wear simple clothing made from animal hides or plant fibers. They are armed with primitive weapons, such as clubs, spears, stone axes, and bows. Despite their primitive technology, cavemen are skilled hunters and warriors, and they are particularly adept at surviving in their harsh environments.

Cavemen are motivated primarily by survival and the protection of their tribe. They are typically wary of outsiders, but they may be friendly or hostile depending on their past experiences and the behavior of those they encounter. Cavemen value strength, courage, and skill in hunting and warfare, and they often have complex spiritual beliefs and rituals.

Cavemen may live in caves, simple huts, or other primitive dwellings, often in remote or inaccessible locations. These settlements are typically simple and functional, with few luxuries or comforts. Cavemen will defend their homes and families fiercely, and they may set traps or other defenses to protect their territory.

Cavemen are sometimes encountered by explorers, adventurers, or settlers who venture into unexplored or remote regions. In some cases, cavemen may be hostile to these intruders, seeing them as threats to their territory or way of life. In other cases, they may be curious or even friendly, especially if the newcomers offer useful trade goods or demonstrate peaceful intentions.
