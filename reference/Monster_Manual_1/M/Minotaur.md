Minotaurs are large, muscular humanoids with the head of a bull. They attack with their horns and bite, or with weapons, usually a large axe or flail. They have infravision to 60'. They never get lost, even in the most complex maze or labyrinth. Minotaurs are found in labyrinths, ruins, and underground caverns. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Minotaurs speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. They are known for their great strength and their ability to navigate mazes, which makes them particularly dangerous in labyrinthine environments. Minotaurs are particularly fond of human flesh, and will often keep prisoners to devour later. They are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful evil beings, as they are loyal servants if treated well. Minotaurs have excellent senses of smell and hearing, allowing them to detect the presence of creatures from a considerable distance. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage.
