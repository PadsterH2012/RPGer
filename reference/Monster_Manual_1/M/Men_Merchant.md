Merchants are traders who travel between settlements, buying and selling goods for profit. They typically operate in caravans or trading ships, moving goods from areas of abundance to areas of scarcity. Merchants are organized into companies or guilds, each led by a merchant prince or guildmaster who is typically a high-level fighter, thief, or other character class. For every 10 merchants, there will be a caravan master or ship captain who is a fighter of 3rd to 6th level. Merchant caravans also include guards, teamsters, sailors, and other support personnel.

Merchants typically wear light armor, such as leather, for protection while traveling. They are armed with simple weapons, such as daggers or short swords, but they rely primarily on their hired guards for protection. Merchants are skilled in negotiation, appraisal, and other business-related skills, and they are particularly adept at identifying valuable goods and profitable opportunities.

Merchants are motivated primarily by profit, but they also value their reputation and relationships with other traders and customers. They are typically neutral in alignment, concerned more with business than with moral or ethical considerations. However, merchants may be friendly or hostile to adventurers, depending on their past experiences and the behavior of those they encounter.

Merchants may have permanent shops or warehouses in cities or towns, but they spend much of their time traveling between settlements. When on the road, they typically camp in secure locations, such as inns, caravanserais, or fortified camps. Merchants will hire guards to protect their goods and themselves, and they may also employ scouts, guides, or other specialists to help them navigate dangerous or unfamiliar territory.

Merchants are often encountered by adventurers who are traveling between settlements or seeking to buy or sell unusual items. In some cases, merchants may hire adventurers as guards, scouts, or troubleshooters, especially if they are traveling through dangerous areas or dealing with valuable or sensitive goods. Merchants may also serve as sources of information, rumors, or quests, as they often hear news and gossip from many different places.
