Bandits are groups of humans who have turned to robbery and raiding as a way of life. They typically operate in wilderness areas, preying on travelers, merchants, and small settlements. Bandits are organized into bands or gangs, each led by a bandit chief who is typically a fighter of 4th to 7th level. For every 20 bandits, there will be a sub-chief who is a fighter of 2nd to 5th level. Bandit groups may also include other character classes, such as thieves, clerics, or magic-users, who serve as advisors or specialists.

Bandits typically wear leather armor and carry shields, giving them an armor class of 6. They are armed with a variety of weapons, including swords, spears, bows, and daggers. Bandits on horseback may use lances or other mounted weapons. Bandits are skilled in ambush tactics and will often set up roadblocks or other traps to catch their victims by surprise.

Bandits are motivated primarily by greed, and they will typically target those who appear wealthy or vulnerable. They are not usually interested in killing for its own sake, and they will often offer their victims the choice of surrendering their valuables or fighting. However, bandits can be ruthless when faced with resistance, and they will not hesitate to kill those who oppose them.

Bandits may have hideouts or lairs in remote areas, such as caves, abandoned ruins, or fortified camps. These lairs are typically well-hidden and may be protected by traps or sentries. Bandits will store their accumulated treasure in these lairs, along with supplies, spare weapons, and other necessities.

Bandits are sometimes hired as mercenaries by local lords or other powerful individuals. In times of war or unrest, bandit groups may grow in size and power, becoming a significant threat to the stability of a region. Some bandit leaders may even aspire to carve out their own territories or kingdoms.
