Dervishes and nomads are desert or plains dwellers who follow a religious or spiritual way of life. They typically live in tribes or bands that move from place to place, following water sources, grazing lands, or other resources. Dervishes are organized into tribes, each led by a sheikh who is typically a fighter of 6th to 9th level. For every 40 dervishes, there will be a sub-chief who is a fighter of 3rd to 6th level. Dervish tribes also include clerics or holy men who serve as spiritual leaders and advisors.

Dervishes typically wear light armor, such as leather, and carry shields. They are armed with a variety of weapons, including scimitars, spears, bows, and daggers. Dervishes on horseback may use lances or other mounted weapons. Dervishes are skilled in desert or plains survival and warfare, and they are particularly adept at mounted combat.

Dervishes are motivated primarily by their religious or spiritual beliefs, which may involve devotion to a particular deity, philosophy, or way of life. They are typically honorable and follow a strict code of conduct, which may include hospitality to guests, protection of the weak, and defense of their faith. Dervishes may be friendly or hostile to outsiders, depending on their beliefs and the behavior of those they encounter.

Dervishes may live in tents, yurts, or other portable dwellings, which they can pack up and move as needed. These dwellings are typically simple but functional, designed to provide shelter from the harsh desert or plains environment. Dervishes will defend their camps and families fiercely, and they may set sentries or other defenses to protect their territory.

Dervishes are sometimes encountered by travelers, merchants, or adventurers who cross the deserts or plains where they live. In some cases, dervishes may be hostile to these intruders, seeing them as threats to their territory or way of life. In other cases, they may be hospitable or even friendly, especially if the newcomers show respect for their customs and beliefs.
