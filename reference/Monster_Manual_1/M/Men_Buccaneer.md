Buccaneers and pirates are seafaring bandits who prey on shipping and coastal settlements. They typically operate from ships or hidden coastal bases, using their mobility and knowledge of the sea to evade authorities and strike at vulnerable targets. Pirates are organized into crews, each led by a captain who is typically a fighter of 4th to 7th level. For every 20 pirates, there will be a lieutenant who is a fighter of 2nd to 5th level. Pirate crews may also include other character classes, such as thieves, clerics, or magic-users, who serve as navigators, quartermasters, or other specialists.

Pirates typically wear light armor, such as leather, to allow for mobility on ships. They are armed with a variety of weapons, including cutlasses, daggers, and pistols or other ranged weapons. Pirates are skilled in naval combat and boarding actions, and they will often use grappling hooks and other specialized equipment to capture enemy vessels.

Pirates are motivated primarily by greed, and they will typically target merchant ships or coastal settlements that appear wealthy or vulnerable. They are not usually interested in killing for its own sake, and they will often offer their victims the choice of surrendering their valuables or fighting. However, pirates can be ruthless when faced with resistance, and they will not hesitate to kill those who oppose them.

Pirates may have hideouts or lairs in remote coastal areas, such as hidden coves, small islands, or fortified coastal settlements. These lairs are typically well-hidden and may be protected by natural features or defenses. Pirates will store their accumulated treasure in these lairs, along with supplies, spare weapons, and other necessities.

Pirates are sometimes hired as privateers by nations at war, given letters of marque that authorize them to attack enemy shipping. In times of war or unrest, pirate activity may increase, as more ships turn to piracy and existing pirate crews grow in size and power. Some pirate captains may even aspire to establish their own pirate kingdoms or confederations.
