The mimic is a strange creature that can change its shape to resemble a wooden or stone object, such as a chest, door, or statue. It attacks by striking with a pseudopod, which does 3-12 hit points of damage. It also secretes a glue-like substance that holds fast any creature that touches it, preventing them from escaping. Only a successful strength check or a dispel magic spell can free a stuck victim. The mimic is immune to acid and cannot be affected by polymorphing. It can see in darkness up to 90'. Mimics are found in dungeons and ruins, where they wait for prey to approach them. They are intelligent and cunning, and will often position themselves in places where adventurers are likely to touch them, such as at the end of a corridor or in a treasure room. Mimics speak the common tongue and several other languages. They are particularly feared for their ability to disguise themselves as ordinary objects, which can lead to nasty surprises for unwary adventurers. There are two types of mimics: the smaller, more intelligent variety described above, and a larger, less intelligent variety that is more aggressive and cannot speak. Both types are dangerous predators that should be approached with caution.
