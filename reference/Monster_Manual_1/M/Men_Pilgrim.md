Pilgrims are religious travelers who journey to holy sites or shrines as an act of devotion or penance. They typically travel in groups for safety and companionship, following established pilgrimage routes or seeking out remote or legendary locations. Pilgrims are led by a high priest or pilgrim leader who is typically a cleric of 5th to 9th level. For every 10 pilgrims, there will be a lesser priest who is a cleric of 2nd to 5th level. Pilgrim groups may also include fighters, paladins, or other character classes who serve as guards or protectors.

Pilgrims typically wear simple clothing and carry few possessions, as a sign of humility and devotion. They are armed with simple weapons, such as staves, clubs, or daggers, but they rely primarily on their faith and the protection of their deity. Pilgrims are skilled in religious knowledge and rituals, and they are particularly adept at identifying holy symbols, relics, and sacred locations.

Pilgrims are motivated primarily by their religious or spiritual beliefs, which may involve devotion to a particular deity, philosophy, or way of life. They are typically peaceful and non-violent, seeking enlightenment, blessing, or forgiveness rather than conflict or material gain. However, pilgrims may be friendly or hostile to adventurers, depending on their beliefs and the behavior of those they encounter.

Pilgrims spend most of their time traveling between holy sites, staying in temples, monasteries, or other religious establishments when available. When on the road, they typically camp in simple conditions, relying on the hospitality of local communities or the protection of their deity. Pilgrims may hire guards or guides to help them navigate dangerous or unfamiliar territory, but they often trust in divine protection rather than worldly defenses.

Pilgrims are often encountered by adventurers who are traveling between settlements or exploring remote areas. In some cases, pilgrims may seek the help of adventurers to protect them from bandits, monsters, or other threats. Pilgrims may also serve as sources of information, rumors, or quests, especially regarding religious or supernatural matters.
