# MEN

Men are humans, the most common and widespread of all intelligent species. They are found in virtually every environment and climate, from the frozen north to the steaming jungles of the south, from the highest mountains to the deepest caverns. Men are adaptable and resourceful, able to survive and thrive in a wide variety of conditions. They are also diverse in their cultures, beliefs, and behaviors, ranging from the most civilized and sophisticated to the most primitive and barbaric.

Men are typically of medium size, standing between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighing between 125 and 250 pounds. They have a wide range of physical characteristics, including various skin colors, hair colors, and eye colors. Men are omnivorous and can eat a wide variety of foods. They are also capable of using tools and weapons, and many have developed complex technologies and societies.

Men are social creatures and typically live in groups, ranging from small family units to vast empires. They have developed complex languages, religions, and social structures. Men are also capable of a wide range of emotions and behaviors, from the most noble and selfless to the most cruel and selfish. They are capable of both great good and great evil, and their alignment can range from lawful good to chaotic evil.

Men are typically not as strong or tough as some other humanoid species, such as orcs or ogres, but they make up for this with their intelligence, adaptability, and social organization. They are also capable of learning and using magic, though not all men have this ability. Men are also capable of interbreeding with some other humanoid species, such as elves and orcs, producing half-elves and half-orcs.
