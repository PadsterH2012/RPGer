Mermen are aquatic humanoids with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a fish. They attack with various weapons, usually tridents, spears, or crossbows. They can breathe water but not air, and will die if removed from water for more than 1 turn. They can see in darkness up to 60'. Mermen live in underwater cities built of coral and other sea materials. They are friendly with other good-aligned aquatic races, but are enemies of sahuagin and other evil sea creatures. Mermen speak their own language, the common tongue, and can communicate with most intelligent aquatic creatures. Mermen are known for their beautiful singing voices, which can be heard for miles underwater. They are excellent swimmers and can navigate the darkest depths with ease. Mermen are more sociable than many aquatic races, and will sometimes trade with surface dwellers who come to their waters in peace. They are skilled crafters of items that function underwater, including special weapons, armor, and magical items. Mermen have a special affinity for dolphins and other intelligent sea creatures, often forming close bonds with them. They are particularly protective of coral reefs and other underwater ecosystems, and will defend them against any threat.
