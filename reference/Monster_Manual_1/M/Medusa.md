The medusa is a hideous humanoid creature with snakes for hair. It attacks with a weapon, usually a bow or short sword, or with its snake-hair, which does 1-4 hit points of damage and injects a poison that kills the victim unless a saving throw versus poison is made. Its most feared attack, however, is its gaze, which turns to stone any creature that meets its eyes unless a saving throw versus petrification is made. This gaze has a range of 3". The medusa can be viewed safely in a mirror, but if the medusa sees its own reflection, it must save versus petrification or be turned to stone. Medusas are found in ruins, caves, and other desolate places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak the common tongue and several other languages. Medusas are particularly feared for their petrifying gaze, which can turn entire groups of adventurers to stone in seconds. They often disguise themselves with hooded cloaks and veils to lure victims close before revealing their true nature. Medusas are sometimes served by other evil creatures, who are careful never to look directly at their mistress. They are particularly vulnerable to their own gaze, and clever adventurers can often use mirrors to defeat them.
