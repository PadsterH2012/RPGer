Berserkers are human warriors who fight with uncontrolled fury and madness. They are typically found in barbarian tribes or warrior cultures that value strength and ferocity in battle. Berserkers are led by a chief who is a fighter of 4th to 7th level. For every 20 berserkers, there will be a sub-chief who is a fighter of 2nd to 5th level. Berserker groups may also include shamans or witch doctors who serve as spiritual leaders and advisors.

Berserkers typically wear no armor, relying on their ferocity and disregard for personal safety to overwhelm their enemies. They are armed with a variety of weapons, including axes, swords, spears, and hammers. Berserkers gain a +2 bonus to damage due to their strength and fury. When in their battle rage, berserkers are immune to fear and will continue fighting even when severely wounded.

Berserkers are motivated primarily by a desire for glory and honor in battle. They seek out worthy opponents and will often challenge them to single combat. Berserkers are not typically interested in material wealth, except as trophies or symbols of their prowess. They value courage, strength, and skill in battle above all else.

Berserkers may live in tribal villages or nomadic camps, often in harsh or remote environments such as mountains, forests, or tundra. These settlements are typically simple and functional, with few luxuries or comforts. Berserkers will defend their homes and families with the same ferocity they display in battle.

Berserkers are sometimes hired as mercenaries by local lords or other powerful individuals who value their fearlessness and combat prowess. In times of war, berserker bands may join larger armies, serving as shock troops or elite warriors. Some berserker leaders may even aspire to unite multiple tribes or bands under their leadership, forming powerful warrior confederations.
