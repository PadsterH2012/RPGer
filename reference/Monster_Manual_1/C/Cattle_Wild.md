Wild cattle roam many wilderness areas, and they are frequently encountered. They are likely to flee any threat, although the males of the herd are likely (75%) to attack if the intruders come upon the herd before it has a chance to run away (see BULL). There is also a 25% chance that a herd of wild cattle will stampede directly at the party. If cattle stampede and there is no cover (rocks, trees, logs, a wall, etc.) then roll two 4-sided dice for each member of the party in the path of the stampede in order to find how many cattle trample each party member. Trampling causes 1-4 hit points of damage per creature trampling.
