Giant crabs are larger versions of normal crabs. They attack with their powerful claws, each of which does 2-12 hit points of damage. Giant crabs are found in coastal waters, tidal pools, and underwater caves. They are not intelligent, and rely on instinct to hunt and survive. They are particularly dangerous because of their hard shells, which provide excellent protection against attacks. Giant crabs are excellent at hiding in rocky terrain, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. They have excellent vision and can detect movement from a considerable distance. Giant crabs are known for their ability to regenerate lost limbs, which grow back over the course of several weeks. They are particularly effective in water, where they can move with great speed and agility. Giant crabs are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful aquatic creatures, who value their toughness and their powerful claws. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they have no special defense against. Giant crabs are generally peaceful, but will defend themselves fiercely if threatened. They are known for their scavenging habits, feeding on dead fish and other marine creatures.
