These creatures are not visible to the human eye and can only be detected psionically by means of careful examination of a person's aura. They can be removed only by a cure disease spell. If a psionically endowed creature comes within 1" of cerebral parasites they will attack but the attack will be completely unnoted. Thereafter, whenever psionic abilities, including attacks/defenses, are used, the parasites will drain additional psionic energy to feed upon. Each parasite will drain one energy point. Furthermore, after one has fed upon six psionic energy points it will reproduce another parasite, and thereafter continue to drain energy, as will its offspring. They cannot be psionically attacked.

Cerebral parasites inhabit the astral and ethereal planes as well as the material plane.
