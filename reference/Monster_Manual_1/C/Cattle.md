Cattle are domesticated bovines raised for meat, milk, and labor. They attack with their horns, which do 1-4 hit points of damage. Cattle are found in plains and farmlands, where they graze on grass and other vegetation. They are not aggressive unless threatened, but will defend themselves and their young if necessary. Cattle are particularly vulnerable to predators such as wolves and big cats, which often target the young, old, or weak members of the herd. They are excellent at detecting danger, gaining a +1 bonus to surprise rolls. Cattle are social animals, living in herds led by a dominant bull. They communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations and body language. Cattle are particularly valuable to farmers and herders, who use them for meat, milk, and as beasts of burden. Their hides can be used to make leather, and their horns and bones can be used to make tools and decorative items. Cattle are sometimes used as sacrifices in religious ceremonies, and are considered sacred in some cultures.
