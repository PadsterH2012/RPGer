Crocodiles are large, reptilian predators that inhabit rivers, swamps, and lakes. They attack with their powerful jaws and their tail. They are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to 30 minutes. Crocodiles are found in warm, wet environments, where they hunt for prey. They are not aggressive unless hungry or threatened, but will defend themselves and their young fiercely. Crocodiles are particularly dangerous in water, where they can move with great speed and agility. They are excellent at hiding in murky water, gaining a +3 bonus to surprise rolls. Crocodiles have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They are known for their powerful jaws, which can crush bones and tear flesh with ease. They are particularly effective at ambushing prey, using their ability to remain almost completely submerged with only their eyes and nostrils above water. Crocodiles are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful creatures, who value their toughness and their powerful jaws. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which slows their movements and reduces their effectiveness in combat. Crocodiles are generally peaceful, but will defend their territory fiercely if threatened. They are known for their patience, often waiting motionless for hours until prey comes within reach.
