The couatl is a feathered serpent with rainbow-colored scales and feathered wings. It attacks with its bite, which does 1-3 hit points of damage and injects a poison that kills the victim unless a saving throw versus poison is made. It can also constrict with its body for 2-8 hit points of damage per round. The couatl can cast spells as a 7th level magic-user and a 5th level cleric. It can also use the following spell-like powers at will: detect evil, detect magic, ESP, invisibility, polymorph self, and suggestion. Once per day, it can use the following spell-like powers: create food and water, cure serious wounds, and neutralize poison. The couatl is found in tropical jungles and forests, where it lives in ancient ruins or natural caves. It is intelligent and benevolent, and will aid good-aligned beings in need. It speaks its own language, the common tongue, and several other languages. The couatl is particularly effective against evil creatures, whom it can detect at a distance of up to 9". It is excellent at flying and can hover in place. The couatl is sometimes served by good-aligned creatures, who respect its wisdom and power. It is particularly vulnerable to cold, which it finds painful and disorienting. The couatl is generally peaceful, but will defend itself and others fiercely if threatened. It is known for its wisdom and its ability to see through deception, which makes it a valuable ally and a dangerous enemy.
