Centaurs are creatures with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a horse. They attack with their front hooves and a weapon, usually a club, spear, or bow. Their body is AC 5, while their human torso is AC 4. Centaurs are found in temperate forests and plains, where they live in small tribes. They are intelligent and generally peaceful, but will defend their territory fiercely if threatened. They speak their own language, elvish, and sometimes the common tongue. Centaurs are particularly skilled with bows, gaining a +2 bonus to hit with them. They are excellent runners and can maintain a gallop for hours without tiring. Centaurs are sometimes friendly with elves and druids, who share their love of nature. They are particularly fond of wine and music, and will often hold wild revels in forest clearings. Centaurs are sometimes used as messengers or scouts by good-aligned armies, as they are fast, reliable, and have excellent knowledge of the terrain. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear due to the risk it poses to their forest homes. Centaurs are generally peaceful, but will defend their homes fiercely if threatened. They are known for their wisdom and their connection to nature, which makes them valuable allies and dangerous enemies.
