Giant centipedes are larger versions of normal centipedes. They attack with their bite, which does no damage but injects a poison. The poison is not deadly, but causes the victim to become violently ill for 10 days unless a saving throw versus poison is made. While ill, the victim's Strength and Dexterity are reduced by 2 points. Giant centipedes are found in dungeons, caves, and other dark, damp places. They are not intelligent, and rely on instinct to hunt and survive. They are particularly dangerous in large groups, as they can overwhelm even the strongest warrior with their numbers. Giant centipedes have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can detect food from great distances. Giant centipedes are known for their ability to climb walls and ceilings, which allows them to attack from unexpected directions. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage. Giant centipedes are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful creatures, who lure them to specific areas with regular feedings.
