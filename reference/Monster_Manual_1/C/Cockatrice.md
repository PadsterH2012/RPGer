The cockatrice is a bizarre creature with the head, legs, and wings of a rooster, and the body and tail of a serpent. It attacks with its beak, which does 1-3 hit points of damage. Any creature touched by a cockatrice must save versus petrification or be turned to stone. The cockatrice is found in temperate plains and forests, where it builds nests in hollow trees or caves. It is not aggressive unless threatened, but will defend itself and its nest fiercely. The cockatrice is particularly feared for its petrifying touch, which can turn even the strongest warrior to stone in seconds. It is excellent at flying and can hover in place. The cockatrice is sometimes used as a guardian by more powerful creatures, who value its petrifying ability. It is particularly vulnerable to weasels, which are immune to its petrification and are its natural predators. The cockatrice is generally peaceful, but will defend its territory fiercely if threatened. It is known for its distinctive crowing, which can be heard for miles and is often the first warning that a cockatrice is nearby.
