Camels are large, desert-dwelling mammals known for their ability to go for long periods without water. They attack by biting, which does 1-4 hit points of damage. They can also spit, which causes no damage but can temporarily blind an opponent (save versus poison to avoid). Camels are used as mounts and pack animals in desert regions. They can carry up to 600 pounds and can travel for up to 3 days without water. Camels are known for their stubborn and sometimes ill-tempered nature. They are particularly valuable in desert environments where their ability to conserve water and withstand extreme heat makes them superior to horses for long journeys.
