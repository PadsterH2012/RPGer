The carcass creeper is a scavenger that resembles a large, flat centipede with 8 long tentacles. Its body is AC 3, while its tentacles are AC 7. It attacks with its tentacles, which secrete a paralytic poison. Any creature hit by a tentacle must save versus paralyzation or be paralyzed for 2-8 turns. The carcass creeper then kills its paralyzed victim with its mandibles and drags the body away to feed. The carcass creeper is found in dungeons, caves, and other underground areas, where it scavenges for food. It is not intelligent, and relies on instinct to hunt and survive. It is particularly dangerous because of its paralytic poison, which can render even the strongest warrior helpless. The carcass creeper is excellent at hiding in dark corners and crevices, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. It has excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 90 feet. The carcass creeper is immune to its own paralytic poison, but is vulnerable to fire, which it fears. It is particularly effective against lone adventurers, whom it can paralyze and kill with ease. The carcass creeper is sometimes used as a guardian by more powerful creatures, who lure it to specific areas with regular feedings.
