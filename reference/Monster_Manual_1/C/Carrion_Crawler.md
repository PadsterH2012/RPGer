The carrion crawler is a scavenger that inhabits underground areas. It resembles a giant caterpillar with eight tentacles surrounding its mouth. It attacks with these tentacles, each of which secretes a paralyzing poison. Any creature hit by a tentacle must save versus paralysis or be paralyzed for 2-12 turns. The carrion crawler's body is AC 3, while its tentacles are AC 7. Carrion crawlers can climb walls and ceilings with ease, and often attack from above. They are attracted to the smell of carrion and will follow the scent of dead or dying creatures. Carrion crawlers are not intelligent, and will attack anything that moves. They are found in dungeons, caves, and sewers, where they feed on the remains of other creatures. They have excellent vision and can see in darkness up to 90 feet. Carrion crawlers are particularly feared for their paralyzing tentacles, which can render even the strongest warrior helpless in seconds.
