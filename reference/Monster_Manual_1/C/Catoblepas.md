The catoblepas is a bizarre creature that resembles a buffalo with a long, snake-like neck and a boar-like head. It attacks with its tail, which does 1-6 hit points of damage. Its most feared attack, however, is its death gaze. Any creature that meets the gaze of the catoblepas must save versus death magic or die instantly. Due to the creature's weak neck, it can only raise its head for short periods, and its gaze has a range of only 6". The catoblepas is found in swamps and marshes, where it feeds on poisonous plants and fungi that other creatures cannot eat. It is not very intelligent, but is cunning enough to use its death gaze effectively. It is particularly dangerous because of its death gaze, which can kill even the strongest warrior instantly. The catoblepas is slow-moving and prefers to avoid conflict, but will defend itself if threatened. It is particularly vulnerable to attacks from behind, as it cannot bring its death gaze to bear. The catoblepas is sometimes hunted for its tail, which is believed to have magical properties. Its meat is poisonous and cannot be eaten, but its hide can be used to make armor that is resistant to poison.
