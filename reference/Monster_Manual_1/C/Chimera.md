The chimera is a monstrous creature with the forequarters of a lion, the hindquarters of a goat, the wings of a dragon, and three heads: a lion's, a goat's, and a dragon's. The lion head is AC 6, the goat head is AC 5, and the dragon head is AC 2. It attacks with the lion's two claws, the goat's horns, the lion's bite, the goat's bite, and the dragon's bite. The dragon head can also breathe fire in a cone 5" long and 2" wide at the base, which does damage equal to the chimera's current hit points (save for half damage). It can use this breath weapon three times per day. The chimera is found in hills, mountains, and underground caverns. It is not very intelligent, but is a cunning fighter. It is aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. The chimera is particularly feared for its multiple attacks and its breath weapon, which can devastate entire groups of adventurers. It is excellent at hiding in rocky terrain, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. The chimera is sometimes used as a guardian by more powerful creatures, who value its ferocity and its ability to fly. It is particularly vulnerable to attacks on its less armored heads, which clever adventurers can target to defeat it more quickly.
