Great cats are large, powerful felines that are skilled hunters. They attack with their claws and bite. If they hit with both front claws, they can also rake with their rear claws for additional damage. Great cats are excellent climbers and swimmers. They are solitary hunters, and are most active at dawn and dusk. They are not usually aggressive toward humans, but will attack if threatened or if their young are in danger. Great cats have excellent night vision and can see in darkness as if it were daylight. They are stealthy hunters and can surprise their prey on a roll of 1-3 on a d6.
