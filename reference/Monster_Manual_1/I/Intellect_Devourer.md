The intellect devourer is a bizarre creature that resembles a brain on four clawed legs. It has no visible sensory organs, but can detect the presence of other creatures through psionics. It attacks with its claws, each of which does 1-4 hit points of damage. It can also use psionic blast, which stuns all within 6" who fail a saving throw versus wands for 1-4 rounds. Its most feared attack, however, is its ability to enter the body of a stunned or unconscious humanoid, devouring the victim's brain and taking control of the body. The intellect devourer is immune to all mind-affecting spells, and can only be hit by magical weapons. It has a natural magic resistance of 90%. Intellect devourers are found in underground caverns and ruins, where they hunt for intelligent prey. They are highly intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak their own language and can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. Intellect devourers are particularly feared for their ability to take over the bodies of their victims, which they can use to infiltrate humanoid societies. They are often found in the company of mind flayers, whom they serve as scouts and spies.
