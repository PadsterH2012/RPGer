Imps are minor devils from the Nine Hells. They appear as small, winged humanoids with red skin, small horns, and a barbed tail. They attack with their tail, which does 1-4 hit points of damage and injects a poison that causes the victim to fall into a coma for 1-6 turns unless a saving throw versus poison is made. Imps can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to fire, cold, and electricity. They can become invisible at will, and can polymorph themselves into a raven, giant rat, or goat. They can detect good, detect magic, and detect invisible objects at will. Once per day, they can use suggestion. Imps are found in the Nine Hells, or serving evil spellcasters as familiars. They are intelligent and cunning, and enjoy causing mischief and harm. They speak the common tongue, the language of devils, and several other languages. Imps are particularly feared for their ability to turn invisible and their poisonous tail. They are often used as spies and messengers by more powerful devils. Imps that serve as familiars grant their masters a +1 bonus to saving throws against fire, a +2 bonus to saving throws against poison, and the ability to regenerate 1 hit point per turn.
