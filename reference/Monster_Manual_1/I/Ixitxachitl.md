Ixitxachitl are intelligent, evil manta ray-like creatures that dwell in warm coastal waters. They attack with their barbed tail, which does 3-12 hit points of damage. Some ixitxachitl are clerics, with spell abilities according to their level (1st to 6th level). Vampiric ixitxachitl are larger (4+4 to 8+8 HD) and can drain 1-4 levels with their bite. Ixitxachitl live in underwater caves and ruins, forming into tribes led by the most powerful individuals. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They are particularly hostile toward surface dwellers and good-aligned aquatic races. Ixitxachitl speak their own language and can communicate with most intelligent aquatic creatures. They are known for their cruelty and their practice of sacrificing captives to their evil deity. They often raid coastal settlements and ships for slaves and food. Ixitxachitl are excellent swimmers and can maneuver with great agility in water. They are vulnerable when out of water, as they cannot move effectively on land. Ixitxachitl are particularly feared by sailors and coastal dwellers, as they can attack ships from below and drag crew members underwater to drown.
