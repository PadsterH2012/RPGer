The Irish deer, also known as the giant deer or Irish elk, is a prehistoric deer with enormous antlers spanning up to 12 feet. It attacks with its hooves and antlers. If it can charge for at least 30', it gains a +2 bonus to hit and does double damage with its antlers. Irish deer are found in temperate forests and plains. They are not aggressive unless threatened, but will defend themselves and their young if necessary. They are particularly dangerous during the rutting season, when males become territorial and aggressive. Irish deer are herbivores, feeding on leaves, grass, and other vegetation. They are social animals, living in small herds led by a dominant male. They are particularly valued by hunters for their impressive antlers, which can be worth up to 1,000 gold pieces. Irish deer are excellent runners and can outpace most predators. They have keen senses of smell and hearing, allowing them to detect danger from a considerable distance. Despite their size and power, Irish deer are vulnerable to coordinated attacks by predators such as wolves and big cats, which will target the young, old, or weak members of the herd.
