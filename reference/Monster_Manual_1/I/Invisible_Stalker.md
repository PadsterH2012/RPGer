The invisible stalker is a creature from the Elemental Plane of Air. As its name suggests, it is naturally invisible, and can only be seen with detect invisible, true seeing, or similar magic. It attacks with its powerful fists, which do 4-16 hit points of damage. Due to its invisibility, it surprises opponents on a roll of 1-5 on a d6. Invisible stalkers are typically encountered only when summoned by a magic-user using the invisible stalker spell. They are bound to perform a specific task, which they will carry out to the letter, though they will look for loopholes if the task is particularly onerous or dangerous. Once the task is completed, they return to their home plane. Invisible stalkers are intelligent and resentful of being summoned and bound to service. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and the language of air elementals. They are particularly effective as trackers and assassins, as they can follow a scent trail for miles and their invisibility makes them nearly impossible to detect. Invisible stalkers are immune to poison and most other effects that target living creatures, as they are not truly alive in the conventional sense. They do not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, and can function indefinitely unless destroyed.
