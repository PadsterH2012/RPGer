Yellow mold is a fungus that grows on walls, ceilings, and floors in dungeons and caves. It does not attack physically, but if touched or struck, it emits a cloud of spores in a 10' cube. Any creature caught in this cloud must save versus poison or die. Fire causes yellow mold to burst into spores automatically. Yellow mold is immune to all attacks except fire, which destroys it. Cold and cure disease spells will temporarily prevent it from emitting spores. Yellow mold is found in dungeons, caves, and other dark, damp places. It is not intelligent, and has no attacks other than its deadly spores. Yellow mold is particularly dangerous because it is often mistaken for harmless fungus until it is too late. It can grow on any surface, and can spread rapidly in suitable conditions. Yellow mold reproduces by releasing spores, which can grow into new mold within a few days in suitable conditions. It is immune to poison and most other effects that target living creatures, as it has no internal organs or conventional biology. Yellow mold is particularly feared by adventurers because it can kill instantly with its deadly spores, making it one of the most dangerous dungeon hazards.
