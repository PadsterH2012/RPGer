Yetis are large, ape-like creatures with white fur that inhabit cold, mountainous regions. They attack with their powerful claws. If both claws hit the same victim in the same round, the yeti hugs its opponent for an additional 2-12 hit points of damage. Yetis are difficult to spot in snowy environments, gaining a +2 bonus to surprise rolls. Their gaze causes fear in any creature that meets their eyes unless a saving throw versus paralyzation is made. Yetis are immune to cold. They take double damage from fire. Yetis are found in arctic mountains, where they live in caves and hunt for food. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning hunters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Yetis speak no languages. Yetis are particularly feared for their ability to blend into snowy environments and their powerful hug, which can crush even the strongest warrior. They are excellent climbers and can navigate icy terrain with ease. Yetis are sometimes captured and trained by frost giants or other powerful beings to serve as guardians, though this is difficult due to their aggressive nature. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage.
