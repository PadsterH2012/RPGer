The BEHOLDER (eye tyrant, sphere of many eyes) is most frequently found underground, although it infrequently will lair in desolate wildernesses. The globular body of this monster is supported by levitation, and it floats slowly about as it wills. Atop the sphere are 10 eyestalks, while in its central area are a great eleventh eye and a large mouth filled with pointed teeth. The body is protected by a hard chitinous covering. The creature's eyestalks and eyes are also protected, although less well (thus the armor classes of 2 and 7 respectively). Because of its particular nature the BEHOLDER is able to withstand the loss of its eyestalks, these members are not computed as part of its hit point damage potential, and lost eyestalks will eventually grow back (1 week per lost member). The body of the monster can withstand two-thirds of its total damage potential, while the great central eye can withstand one-third this total, i.e. a BEHOLDER with 45 hit points can withstand 30 hit points of damage to its body before being killed; the eleventh eye can withstand 15 points before ceasing to function. Eyestalks take from 8 to 12 hit points each before being lost. The body of a BEHOLDER represents 75% of potential hit area, the central eye and the eyestalks 10% each, and the 10 small eyes 5%.

**Eyes**: The various eyes of a BEHOLDER each have a different function. Typically only the central eye, plus 1-4 of those on stalks are able to function considering that the attack is coming from an arc 90' before the monster. If attacks come from 180' double the number of eyestalks able to function, and for 270' or 360' triple or quadruple the number. Attacks from above enable all 10 eyestalks to function, but the central eye cannot. Functions of the eyes are:

1. Charm person spell
2. Charm monster spell
3. Sleep spell
4. Telekinese 2,500 GP wt.
5. Flesh-stone ray (3" range)
6. Disintegrate ray (2" range)
7. Fear (as a wand)
8. Slow spell
9. Cause serious wound (5" range)
10. Death ray (4" range)
11. Anti-magic ray (14" range)

**Nature**: The BEHOLDER is hateful, aggressive, and avaricious. They will usually attack immediately. If confronted by a particularly powerful party there is a 50% chance they will listen to negotiations - either to be bribed not to Attack or to pay a ransom to not be attacked, depending on the strength of the opposing party. They can speak their own language as well as that tongue known to lawful evil creatures.
