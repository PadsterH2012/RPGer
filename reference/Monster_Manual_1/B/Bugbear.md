Bugbears are large, hairy goblinoids with bear-like features. They attack with various weapons, usually morning stars, spears, or swords, which do damage according to the weapon type plus a +1 bonus due to their strength. They can move very quietly despite their size, gaining a +3 bonus to surprise rolls. Bugbears have infravision to 60'. They are strong and aggressive, and enjoy bullying weaker creatures. Bugbears live in caves, ruins, or crude huts in wilderness areas. They form into small tribes led by the strongest member. They often enslave other creatures to serve them. Bugbears speak their own language, goblin, and sometimes the common tongue. They are known for their stealth and their love of ambush tactics. Bugbears are particularly fond of surprising their victims, and will often set up elaborate ambushes. They are lazy by nature and prefer to let their slaves do most of the work, but they are fierce fighters when roused to battle. Bugbears have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can track prey for miles. Bugbears are sometimes served by dire wolves or other predatory creatures, which they train as hunting beasts and guards.
