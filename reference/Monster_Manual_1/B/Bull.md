The bull is a dangerous opponent, being aggressive and easily aroused to anger. There is a 75% chance that if approached within 8" it will attack. A charging bull will do 3-12 points of damage upon impact with an additional 1-4 points of trampling damage. A charge must cover at least 30'. Such animals as the wild ox and the aurochs fall under this general class. When a herd is present there will be several bulls which will defend the rest.
