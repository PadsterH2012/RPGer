These dangerous herd animals of tropical and subtropical plains will usually attack if approached too closely (6" or less). When attacking, the whole herd is likely to charge. A charging buffalo does 3-18 hit points of damage impacting and 1-4 points trampling. A charge must cover at least 40'. Some species of buffalo (50% chance) are non-aggressive and will flee if threatened.
