Baboons are basically herbivorous, group animals. The tribe will be led by 2-8 large males (+1 hit point damage on attacks). Half of the tribe will be young which will not Attack. If the home territory of a tribe is invaded the baboons will attempt to drive the invaders off, but it is 90% likely that the tribe will flee if faced by determined resistance.
