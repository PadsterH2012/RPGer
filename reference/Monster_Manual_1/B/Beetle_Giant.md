The bombardier beetle can spray a noxious chemical from its abdomen that causes 3-12 points of damage (save versus poison for half damage). This spray can be used once every 6 rounds and affects an area 5' wide and 5' long. The bombardier beetle is usually reddish-brown in color with black wing cases.

**Boring Beetle**:
