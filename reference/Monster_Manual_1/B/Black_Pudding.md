The black pudding is a horrific, amorphous blob of black, tarry substance. It attacks by striking with a pseudopod, which does 3-24 hit points of damage. Its acidic secretions dissolve wood, leather, cloth, and metal (except gold) in 1 round. It can dissolve 2" of wood or 1" of metal (except gold) per melee round. The black pudding is immune to cold, lightning, and attacks from blunt weapons. Lightning and blunt weapons cause it to divide into smaller puddings, each with hit points proportional to their size. It can be harmed by fire and edged weapons. The black pudding can climb walls and ceilings, and can squeeze through cracks as small as 1 inch wide. It can travel underwater, along the bottom of water bodies. The black pudding is found in dungeons, caves, and other underground areas, where it feeds on organic matter. It is not intelligent, and will attack anything that comes within reach. The black pudding is particularly dangerous because it can flow through small openings and attack from unexpected directions. It can climb walls and ceilings, and can squeeze through cracks as small as 1 inch wide. Black puddings reproduce by division, with each piece growing into a new pudding. They are immune to poison and most other effects that target living creatures, as they have no internal organs or conventional biology.
