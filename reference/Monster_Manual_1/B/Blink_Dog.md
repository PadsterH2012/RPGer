Blink dogs are intelligent canines with the ability to blink in and out of the Ethereal Plane. They attack with their bite, which does 1-6 hit points of damage. Their most notable ability is their blinking, which allows them to teleport up to 40' once per round. This gives them a +2 bonus to surprise rolls and makes them difficult to hit in combat. Blink dogs are found in temperate plains and forests, where they live in packs. They are intelligent and good-aligned, and will often aid good-aligned beings in need. They speak their own language, which consists of barks, yaps, and growls. Blink dogs are particularly effective against evil creatures, whom they hunt relentlessly. They are excellent trackers and can follow a scent trail for miles. Blink dogs are sometimes used as guardians by good-aligned beings, who value their intelligence and loyalty. They are natural enemies of displacer beasts, and the two species will always fight if they encounter each other. Blink dogs are particularly vulnerable to spells that prevent teleportation, which negate their blinking ability and make them much easier to hit in combat.
