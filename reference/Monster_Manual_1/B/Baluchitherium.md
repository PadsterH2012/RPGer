This creature is a prehistoric ancestor of the rhinoceros. It is a huge herbivorous mammal with a tendency to charge at anything nearby in order to trample it. If two are encountered they will be a mated pair, if three are encountered the third will be a young baluchitherium (roll percentile dice to determine size).
