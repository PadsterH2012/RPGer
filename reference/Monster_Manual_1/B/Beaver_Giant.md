Giant beavers are larger versions of normal beavers, about the size of a small bear. They are semi-aquatic mammals with webbed hind feet, large flat tails, and powerful teeth. They attack by biting with their sharp incisors. Giant beavers are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to 5 minutes. They live in colonies in rivers and lakes, building large dams and lodges from trees they fell with their teeth. They are generally peaceful, but will defend their territory and young if threatened. Giant beavers feed on the bark and twigs of trees, particularly aspen, willow, and cottonwood. Their dams can significantly alter the local environment, creating ponds and wetlands that attract other wildlife.
