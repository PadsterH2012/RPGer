The bulette, or landshark, is a fearsome predator that burrows through the earth and erupts from the ground to attack its prey. It has a heavily armored body, with its head and back being AC -2, its sides and legs AC 4, and its belly AC 6. It attacks with its two front claws and its enormous bite. If it charges for at least 30', it can leap up to 8' high and 10' forward, bringing all four claws to bear for 3-18 hit points of damage each. The bulette can burrow through the earth at a rate of 3" per round, leaving a tunnel 5' in diameter. It can sense vibrations through the ground up to 60' away, allowing it to detect the approach of potential prey. The bulette is found in hills and plains, where it hunts for food. It is not intelligent, and relies on instinct to hunt and survive. It is particularly fond of horses and halflings, and will always attack them in preference to other prey. The bulette is a voracious eater, consuming everything except wood, stone, and metal. It is particularly feared for its ability to burrow through the earth and attack from below, which can catch even the most alert adventurers by surprise. The bulette is immune to poison and most other effects that target living creatures, as it has a unique biology. It is particularly vulnerable to attacks on its softer underbelly, which clever adventurers can target to defeat it more quickly.
