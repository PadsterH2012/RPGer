Giant bees are larger versions of normal honeybees. They attack with their stingers, which do 1-4 hit points of damage and inject a poison that causes an additional 1-4 hit points of damage unless a saving throw versus poison is made. Once a giant bee stings, it dies within 1 turn. Giant bees are found in temperate forests and plains, where they build large hives in hollow trees or caves. They are not aggressive unless their hive is threatened, but will defend it fiercely. Giant bees produce honey, which is highly valued for its sweetness and medicinal properties. A single giant bee hive can contain up to 100 pounds of honey, worth 1-6 gold pieces per pound. The royal jelly produced for the queen bee is even more valuable, worth 100-600 gold pieces per ounce, and there will be 1-4 ounces in a hive. Giant bees are particularly protective of their queen, who is twice the size of normal giant bees and has 2 hit dice. They are vulnerable to smoke, which causes them to become docile and less likely to attack. Giant bees are sometimes captured and raised by druids or rangers, who value their honey and use them to pollinate crops.
