The basilisk is a reptilian monster. Although it has eight legs, its slow metabolic process allows it only slow movement. While it has strong, toothy jaws, the basilisk's major weapon is its gaze by means of which it is able to turn to stone any fleshly creature which meets its glance. However, if its gaze is reflected so that the basilisk sees its own eyes, it will itself be petrified, but this requires light at least equal to bright torchlight and a good, smooth reflector. Basilisks are usually dull brown with yellowish underbellies. Their eyes are glowing pale green. The basilisk is able to see in both the astral and ethereal planes. In the former plane its gaze kills, while in the latter it turns victims to ethereal stone which can only be seen by those who are in that plane or can see ethereal objects.
