Bats are nocturnal flying mammals that use echolocation to navigate in darkness. They are found in caves, ruins, and other dark places. Normal bats feed on insects and fruit, while giant bats are carnivorous and will attack small animals and humanoids. Bats have excellent hearing and can navigate in complete darkness. They are not aggressive unless disturbed or hungry (in the case of giant bats). Bats are particularly active at night and will rarely be encountered during daylight hours. They are vulnerable to loud noises, which can disrupt their echolocation and cause them to flee in confusion.

**Normal Bat**:
Normal bats are small, insectivorous mammals. They attack only if cornered or magically controlled. They have infravision to 30'. They can navigate in complete darkness using echolocation. Normal bats are found in large colonies in caves, ruins, and other dark places. They are not a significant threat to adventurers, but large swarms can cause confusion and panic.

**Giant Bat**:
Giant bats are larger, carnivorous versions of normal bats. They attack with their sharp teeth, which do 1-4 hit points of damage. They have infravision to 90'. They can navigate in complete darkness using echolocation. Giant bats are found in caves, ruins, and other dark places. They are aggressive hunters and will attack small animals and humanoids. Giant bats are sometimes used as mounts by goblins, kobolds, and other small humanoids. They are particularly effective in darkness, where their echolocation gives them an advantage over most prey.
