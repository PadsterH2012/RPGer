Brownies are small, humanoid fey creatures with brown skin and hair. They attack with small weapons, usually daggers or short swords. They can become invisible at will, and can use the following spell-like powers once per day: ESP, mirror image, protection from evil, and ventriloquism. They can also use dimension door once per day, but only to escape. Brownies have a natural magic resistance of 20%. They are immune to all illusion/phantasm spells. Brownies are found in forests and rural areas, where they often live near human or demihuman settlements. They are intelligent and benevolent, and will often aid good-aligned beings in need. They speak their own language, elvish, and the common tongue. Brownies are particularly fond of helping farmers and households with chores, especially at night when the residents are asleep. They expect to be rewarded with small gifts of food or drink, and will become offended if their help is taken for granted. Brownies are excellent at hiding and moving silently, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls. They are particularly vulnerable to iron, which they find painful to touch. Brownies are generally peaceful, but will defend their homes fiercely if threatened. They are known for their love of pranks and their ability to disappear at will, which makes them difficult to catch or harm.
