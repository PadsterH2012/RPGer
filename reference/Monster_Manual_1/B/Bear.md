Bears are omnivorous mammals that are generally territorial and solitary. They are found in forests, mountains, and other wilderness areas. They attack with their claws and bite. If they hit with both paws in the same round, they will hug their opponent for additional damage. Bears are excellent swimmers and climbers. They are not usually aggressive toward humans, but will attack if threatened or if their young are in danger. Bears have excellent senses of smell and hearing, and can detect the presence of creatures from a considerable distance.

The black bear is the smallest and most common type of bear. It is found in forests and wooded hills. It is not as aggressive as other bears, but will defend itself if cornered.

The brown bear is larger and more aggressive than the black bear. It is found in forests, mountains, and tundra regions. It is a powerful fighter and will often attack intruders in its territory.

The cave bear is the largest and most dangerous type of bear. It is found in mountainous regions, often making its lair in caves. It is very aggressive and will attack almost any creature it encounters.
