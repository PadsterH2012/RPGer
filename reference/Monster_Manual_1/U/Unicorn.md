Unicorns are magical creatures that resemble horses with a single, spiral horn on their foreheads. They attack with their hooves and horn. They can teleport once per day, carrying up to 1,800 g.p. weight with them. They can also detect evil at will. Unicorns have a natural magic resistance of 25%. They can only be approached by maiden humans or elves of good alignment. Anyone else who attempts to approach a unicorn will cause it to flee. Unicorns are found in deep forests, where they live in small herds. They are intelligent and noble, and will aid good-aligned beings in need. They speak their own language, elvish, and the common tongue. Unicorns are particularly effective against evil creatures, whom they can detect at a distance of up to 9". They are excellent runners and can outpace most predators. Unicorns are sometimes served by other forest creatures, who respect their connection to nature. They are particularly vulnerable to evil magic, which they fear, and clever evil spellcasters can often use this to their advantage. Unicorns are generally peaceful, but will defend their forests fiercely if threatened. They are known for their healing abilities, as their horn can cure diseases and neutralize poisons once per day.
