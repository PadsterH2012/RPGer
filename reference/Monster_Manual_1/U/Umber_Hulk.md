The umber hulk is a powerful, burrowing monster with a thick, heavily armored body. It has four eyes, two normal ones and two smaller ones that emit a confusion effect. Any creature that meets the gaze of these smaller eyes must save versus magic or be confused for 1-4 rounds. Umber hulks attack with their powerful claws and mandibles. They can burrow through solid rock at a rate of 3" per round, leaving a tunnel 4' in diameter. Umber hulks are found underground, where they tunnel through the earth in search of prey. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. Umber hulks are particularly feared for their confusion gaze and their ability to burrow through solid rock, which allows them to create ambushes and escape routes. They are excellent at hiding in rocky terrain, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls in such environments. Umber hulks are sometimes served by other evil creatures, who respect their power and ferocity. They are particularly vulnerable to bright light, which they find painful and disorienting. Umber hulks are generally hostile to all other races, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are particularly fond of human flesh, and will often keep prisoners to devour later.
