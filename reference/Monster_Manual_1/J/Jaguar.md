Jaguars are large, powerful cats with spotted coats. They attack with their claws and bite. If they hit with both front claws, they can also rake with their rear claws for 1-6 hit points of damage each. Jaguars are excellent climbers and swimmers. They are solitary hunters, and are most active at dawn and dusk. They are not usually aggressive toward humans, but will attack if threatened or if their young are in danger. Jaguars have excellent night vision and can see in darkness as if it were daylight. They are stealthy hunters and can surprise their prey on a roll of 1-3 on a d6. Jaguars are found in jungles and forests, where they hunt a variety of prey, from fish and turtles to deer and tapirs. They are known for their powerful bite, which can pierce the skulls of their prey. Jaguars are sometimes worshipped as divine beings by primitive tribes, who respect their strength and hunting prowess. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage.
