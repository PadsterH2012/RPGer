Jackalweres are evil shapeshifters that can take the form of a jackal, a jackal-headed humanoid, or a specific human. They attack with a weapon in humanoid form, or with their bite in jackal form. Their most feared attack, however, is their gaze, which causes sleep in any creature that meets their eyes unless a saving throw versus magic is made. The sleep lasts for 2-8 turns. Jackalweres can only be hit by iron or magical weapons. They are immune to all mind-affecting spells. Jackalweres are found in warm, arid regions, where they hunt for human prey. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They often work in small groups, using their sleep gaze to incapacitate victims before killing them. Jackalweres speak the common tongue and their own language. They are particularly feared for their ability to disguise themselves as humans, which they use to lure travelers to their doom. Jackalweres are sometimes served by normal jackals, which they use as scouts and guards. They are particularly vulnerable to silver weapons, which do double damage to them.
