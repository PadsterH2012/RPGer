Jackals are small, dog-like scavengers found in warm, arid regions. They attack with their bite, which does 1-2 hit points of damage. Jackals are not aggressive toward humans unless starving or provoked, but will defend themselves if threatened. They are primarily scavengers, feeding on carrion and the remains of kills made by larger predators. They will also hunt small animals if necessary. Jackals have excellent night vision and can see in darkness up to 60 feet. They have a keen sense of smell and can detect the scent of death from miles away. Jackals are known for their distinctive howling, which they use to communicate with other pack members. They are social animals, living in small family groups. Jackals are sometimes associated with death and the afterlife in various cultures due to their scavenging habits. They are particularly common in desert and savanna regions, where they fill an important ecological niche by cleaning up carrion that would otherwise spread disease.
