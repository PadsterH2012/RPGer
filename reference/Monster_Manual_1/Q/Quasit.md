Quasits are minor demons that often serve as familiars to evil spellcasters. They appear as small, humanoid creatures with horns, a barbed tail, and clawed hands and feet. They attack with their claws and bite. Their claws secrete a poison that causes the victim to lose 1 point of dexterity for 2-12 rounds unless a saving throw versus poison is made. Quasits can polymorph themselves into a bat, giant centipede, or wolf at will. They can become invisible at will, and can cause fear in a 3" radius once per day. They can detect good, detect magic, and detect invisible objects at will. Once per day, they can use a suggestion. Quasits can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to fire, cold, and electricity. They have a natural magic resistance of 25%. Quasits are found in the Abyss, or serving evil spellcasters as familiars. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy causing mischief and harm. They speak the common tongue, the language of demons, and several other languages. Quasits are particularly feared for their ability to turn invisible and their poisonous claws. They are often used as spies and messengers by more powerful demons. Quasits that serve as familiars grant their masters a +1 bonus to saving throws against fire, a +2 bonus to saving throws against poison, and the ability to regenerate 1 hit point per turn.
