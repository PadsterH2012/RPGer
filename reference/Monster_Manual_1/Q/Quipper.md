Quippers are small, aggressive fish with sharp teeth. They attack by biting, which does 1 hit point of damage. They are found in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of fresh water. They are not aggressive unless they smell blood, at which point they enter a feeding frenzy and will attack anything in the water. Quippers are not intelligent, and rely on instinct to hunt and survive. They are particularly dangerous in large groups, as they can quickly overwhelm even the largest creatures with their numbers. Quippers have excellent senses of smell and can detect blood in the water from great distances. They are known for their voracious appetite and their ability to strip flesh from bone in minutes. Quippers are sometimes used as a form of execution by evil humanoids, who throw victims into pools filled with the ravenous fish. They are particularly vulnerable when out of water, as they cannot breathe air and will suffocate if not returned to water within a few minutes. Quippers are generally avoided by most aquatic creatures due to their aggressive nature and tendency to attack in large numbers.
