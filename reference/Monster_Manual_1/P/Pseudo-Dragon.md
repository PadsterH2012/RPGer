Pseudo-dragons are small, dragon-like creatures with reddish-brown scales and a barbed tail. They attack with their tail, which does 1-3 hit points of damage and injects a poison that causes the victim to fall into a coma for 1-6 days unless a saving throw versus poison is made. They can change color to match their surroundings, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls. They have a natural magic resistance of 35%. Pseudo-dragons can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature within 24". They can see invisible creatures and objects. Pseudo-dragons are found in forests and hills, where they live in small caves or hollow trees. They are intelligent and generally friendly, but are shy and will avoid contact with most humanoids. They speak their own language and can communicate telepathically. Pseudo-dragons are particularly fond of halflings and gnomes, and will sometimes form bonds with them. They are excellent flyers and can hover in place. Pseudo-dragons are sometimes sought as familiars by magic-users, as they grant their masters a +2 bonus to saving throws against magical attacks and the ability to communicate telepathically. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which they find painful and disorienting. Pseudo-dragons are generally peaceful, but will defend themselves if threatened. They are known for their intelligence and their ability to communicate telepathically, which makes them valuable companions and allies.
