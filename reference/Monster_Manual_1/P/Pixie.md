Pixies are small, humanoid fey creatures with gossamer wings. They are naturally invisible, and can only be seen when they choose to be or with detect invisible or true seeing magic. They attack with tiny spears or short swords, which do 1-4 hit points of damage. They can also use the following spell-like powers once per day: dancing lights, detect evil, detect good, detect magic, dispel magic, and ESP. They can also cast polymorph self, know alignment, and mirror image once per day. Once per day, a pixie can use a special dust to create a sleep effect or a confusion effect. Pixies have a natural magic resistance of 25%. Pixies are found in deep forests and fey realms, where they live in small communities. They are intelligent and mischievous, and enjoy playing pranks on other creatures. They speak their own language, elvish, and the common tongue. Pixies are particularly fond of music and dancing, and will often hold wild revels in forest clearings. They are excellent flyers and can hover in place. Pixies are sometimes served by small animals and other woodland creatures, who respect their connection to nature. They are particularly vulnerable to iron, which they find painful to touch. Pixies are generally peaceful, but will defend their homes fiercely if threatened. They are known for their love of pranks and their ability to disappear at will, which makes them difficult to catch or harm.
