Pegasi are magnificent winged horses with white, silver, or golden coats. They attack with their hooves and bite. They are excellent flyers and can carry up to 300 pounds in flight. Pegasi are found in remote mountains and forests, where they live in small herds. They are intelligent and noble creatures, but are shy and will generally avoid contact with humanoids. They can be approached only by lawful good characters, and even then only with great patience and gentleness. Pegasi speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. They are particularly fond of elves and will sometimes allow them to ride. Pegasi are sometimes captured and trained as mounts by good-aligned beings, though this is difficult due to their shy nature. A trained pegasus is a loyal and powerful ally. Pegasi eggs and young are highly valued, with a single egg worth up to 5,000 gold pieces. Pegasi have excellent eyesight and can spot movement from miles away. They are particularly protective of their young and will defend them fiercely against any threat. Pegasi are natural enemies of hippogriffs, and the two species will always fight if they encounter each other.
