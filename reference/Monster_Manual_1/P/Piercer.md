Piercers are strange creatures that resemble stalactites. They cling to cave ceilings and drop on passing creatures, impaling them with their sharp, pointed bodies. The damage they do depends on their size: 1 HD piercers do 1-6 damage, 2 HD do 2-12, 3 HD do 3-18, and 4 HD do 4-24. Piercers are 90% undetectable when motionless, as they perfectly mimic stalactites. They can detect vibrations through the air up to 90 feet away, allowing them to sense the approach of potential prey. Piercers are found in caves and underground passages, where they wait for prey to pass beneath them. They are not intelligent, and rely on instinct to hunt and survive. After dropping on prey, piercers slowly climb back to the ceiling to wait for their next victim. This process can take several hours due to their slow movement rate. Piercers reproduce by laying eggs in small crevices in the ceiling. The young piercers hatch with 1 HD and grow larger over time, molting their old shells as they grow. Piercers are particularly dangerous in large groups, as they can drop on an entire party of adventurers simultaneously. They are immune to mind-affecting spells due to their lack of intelligence.
