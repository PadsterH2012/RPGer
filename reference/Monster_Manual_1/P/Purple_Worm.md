The purple worm is a massive, burrowing creature that resembles a giant earthworm with purple skin. It attacks with its huge maw, which does 2-24 hit points of damage, and its stinger, which does 1-8 hit points of damage and injects a poison that kills the victim unless a saving throw versus poison is made. If the purple worm scores a natural 20 on its attack roll with its bite, it swallows its victim whole. Swallowed creatures take 3-18 hit points of damage per round from digestive acids, and will die after 6 rounds. The purple worm can burrow through solid rock at a rate of 3" per round, leaving a tunnel 10' in diameter. Purple worms are found underground, where they tunnel through the earth in search of prey. They are not intelligent, and rely on vibrations to detect the presence of creatures. They will attack anything that causes vibrations in the ground. Purple worms are particularly feared for their ability to swallow victims whole and their deadly poison. They are immune to poison and most other effects that target living creatures, as they have a simple nervous system and biology. Purple worms are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful creatures, who lure them to specific areas with regular feedings. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage.
