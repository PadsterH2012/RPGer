Nixies are small, humanoid water sprites with green skin and hair. They attack with small weapons, usually daggers or short swords. They can also cast a charm person spell once per day, which lasts for one year if not dispelled. For every 10 nixies, they can collectively cast a water breathing spell on a victim, allowing them to take the victim underwater to serve them for a year. Nixies can summon 10 large fish to aid them in combat. Nixies are found in lakes, rivers, and other bodies of fresh water. They are intelligent and mischievous, and enjoy playing pranks on other creatures. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and can communicate with most aquatic creatures. Nixies are particularly fond of music and dancing, and will sometimes emerge from the water to join in the revels of elves or other woodland beings. They are excellent swimmers and can breathe both air and water. Nixies are sometimes served by large fish or other aquatic creatures, whom they charm or befriend. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage. Nixies are generally peaceful, but will defend their underwater homes fiercely if threatened.
