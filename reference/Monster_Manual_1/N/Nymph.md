Nymphs are incredibly beautiful female nature spirits. They have no physical attacks, but their beauty is so great that any male who sees a nymph must save versus magic or be permanently blinded by her beauty. If a nymph disrobes, any male who sees her must save versus magic or die from the sight. Nymphs can dimension door at will, and can cast druid spells as a 7th level druid. They have a natural magic resistance of 50%. Nymphs are found in unspoiled wilderness areas, such as forests, mountains, and lakes. They are intelligent and shy, and will flee if threatened. They speak their own language, elvish, and the common tongue. Nymphs are particularly fond of handsome male humans and elves, and may occasionally form relationships with them. They are excellent healers and can cure serious wounds three times per day. Nymphs are sometimes served by animals and other woodland creatures, who respect their connection to nature. They are particularly vulnerable to pollution and destruction of their natural habitats, which can cause them to sicken and die. Nymphs are generally peaceful, but will defend their homes fiercely if threatened. A lock of nymph hair is a powerful component in many magical potions and items.
