Nagas are intelligent serpentine creatures with human-like heads. They are divided into three main types: guardian nagas, spirit nagas, and water nagas. All nagas are intelligent and can speak the common tongue and several other languages. They are long-lived, with lifespans measured in centuries. Nagas are particularly feared for their combination of physical power, magical abilities, and intelligence, which makes them formidable opponents. They are often found guarding ancient treasures or sacred sites, and will defend these locations fiercely. Nagas are sometimes served by other creatures, who respect their power and wisdom. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which slows their movements and reduces their effectiveness in combat.
