Spirit nagas are large, serpentine creatures with human-like heads. They have dark, mottled scales and glowing, red eyes. They attack with their bite, which does 1-3 hit points of damage and injects a poison that kills the victim unless a saving throw versus poison is made. Spirit nagas can cast spells as a 5th level magic-user. They can also charm with their gaze, which affects any creature that meets their eyes unless a saving throw versus magic is made. Spirit nagas are found in ruins, caves, and other desolate places. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak the common tongue and several other languages. Spirit nagas are particularly feared for their combination of poison, spells, and charm gaze, which can render even the strongest warrior helpless. They are immune to charm and hold spells, and are resistant to fire and lightning. Spirit nagas are sometimes served by undead or other evil creatures, whom they control through fear and magic. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which slows their movements and reduces their effectiveness in combat.
