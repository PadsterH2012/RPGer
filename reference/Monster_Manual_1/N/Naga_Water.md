Water nagas are large, serpentine creatures with human-like heads. They have blue-green scales and large, blue eyes. They attack with their bite, which does 1-4 hit points of damage and injects a poison that causes the victim to fall into a coma for 1-4 turns unless a saving throw versus poison is made. Water nagas can cast spells as a 5th level magic-user. Water nagas are found in lakes, rivers, and other bodies of fresh water. They are intelligent and generally neutral, neither helping nor harming other creatures unless provoked. They speak the common tongue and several other languages. Water nagas are particularly effective in aquatic environments, where they can move with great speed and agility. They are immune to charm and hold spells, and are resistant to fire and lightning. Water nagas are sometimes served by aquatic creatures, who respect their wisdom and power. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which slows their movements and reduces their effectiveness in combat. Water nagas can breathe both air and water, allowing them to operate effectively in both environments.
