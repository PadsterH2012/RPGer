Guardian nagas are large, serpentine creatures with human-like heads. They have golden scales and large, golden eyes. They attack with their bite, which does 1-6 hit points of damage and injects a poison that kills the victim unless a saving throw versus poison is made. They can also spit their poison up to 3", requiring a saving throw versus poison or death. Guardian nagas can cast spells as a 6th level cleric and an 8th level magic-user. Guardian nagas are found in ruins, temples, and other places of power, which they guard against evil intruders. They are intelligent and benevolent, and will aid good-aligned beings in need. They speak the common tongue and several other languages. Guardian nagas are particularly effective against evil creatures, whom they can detect at a distance of up to 9". They are immune to charm and hold spells, and are resistant to fire and lightning. Guardian nagas are sometimes served by good-aligned creatures, who respect their wisdom and power. They are particularly vulnerable to cold, which slows their movements and reduces their effectiveness in combat.
