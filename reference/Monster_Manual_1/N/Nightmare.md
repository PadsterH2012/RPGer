Nightmares are evil, extraplanar horses with coal-black skin, flaming hooves, and glowing red eyes. They attack with their hooves and bite. Their hooves do additional fire damage, and can ignite combustible materials. Nightmares can fly and can travel ethereally, moving between planes at will. They have a natural magic resistance of 50%. Nightmares are found on the lower planes, or serving evil beings as mounts. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy causing fear and pain. They speak the common tongue and several other languages. Nightmares are particularly feared for their ability to travel between planes, which makes them valuable mounts for evil extraplanar beings. They are immune to fire and heat, and are resistant to cold. Nightmares are sometimes used as mounts by night hags, demons, and other evil beings. They are particularly vulnerable to holy water, which does 2-8 hit points of damage per vial. Nightmares can carry up to 300 pounds in flight, and can maintain a gallop for up to 8 hours before needing rest. They are particularly effective at night, gaining a +2 bonus to all attacks in darkness.
