Eels are aquatic, snake-like fish found in various bodies of water. There are several types:

**Electric Eel**:
Electric eels are found in fresh water. They attack with a bite which does 1-3 hit points of damage, plus a shock which does 2-12 hit points of damage (save for half damage). They can shock once per turn. Electric eels can generate a field of electricity that extends about 3 feet around them in water. Electric eels are not actually true eels, but are more closely related to carp and catfish. They can grow up to 8 feet in length and weigh up to 45 pounds. They must surface periodically to breathe air.

**Giant Eel**:
Giant eels are found in salt water. They attack with a bite which does 3-12 hit points of damage. They are aggressive predators which will attack anything that enters their territory. Giant eels often hide in crevices and underwater caves, darting out to attack passing prey. Giant eels can grow up to 20 feet in length and are powerful swimmers. They have poor eyesight but an excellent sense of smell, allowing them to detect blood in the water from great distances.

**Weed Eel**:
Weed eels are found in areas with heavy vegetation. They are camouflaged to look like plants, and surprise opponents on a roll of 1-4 on a d6. They attack with a bite which does 1-4 hit points of damage. They are not aggressive, and will generally only attack if disturbed. Weed eels can change color to match their surroundings, making them extremely difficult to spot when stationary. Weed eels feed primarily on small fish and crustaceans. They are masters of ambush, remaining perfectly still until prey comes within striking distance.
