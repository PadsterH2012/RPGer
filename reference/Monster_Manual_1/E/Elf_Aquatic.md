Aquatic elves are a subrace of elves adapted to life underwater. They have gills and can breathe water, but can only survive out of water for 1-3 hours. They have webbed hands and feet, and their skin is usually blue-green. They have all the abilities of normal elves, and are also skilled in the use of tridents and nets. They live in underwater cities built of coral and other sea materials. They are friendly with other good-aligned aquatic races, but are enemies of sahuagin and other evil sea creatures. Aquatic elves speak their own dialect, the common tongue, and can communicate with most intelligent aquatic creatures.

Aquatic elves are known for their beautiful singing voices, which can be heard for miles underwater. They are excellent swimmers and can navigate the darkest depths with ease. Aquatic elves are more reclusive than their surface cousins, rarely interacting with land-dwelling races. They are skilled crafters of items that function underwater, including special weapons, armor, and magical items. Aquatic elves have a special affinity for dolphins and other intelligent sea creatures, often forming close bonds with them. They are particularly protective of coral reefs and other underwater ecosystems, and will defend them against any threat.
