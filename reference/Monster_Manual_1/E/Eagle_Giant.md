Giant eagles are noble birds of prey which are sometimes used as mounts by elves and other good-aligned beings. They attack with their talons and beak. When diving on prey from at least 100' up, they gain a +4 bonus to hit and do double damage with their talons. Giant eagles nest in high mountains and deep forests. They are intelligent and can speak their own language, as well as the common tongue. They are generally friendly toward good-aligned humanoids, but are fierce enemies of evil creatures, especially orcs and goblins. Giant eagles mate for life and typically produce clutches of 2-5 eggs which both parents help to raise. Giant eagles are proud and noble creatures that value their freedom above all else. They will only serve as mounts for those they respect and trust. They have excellent eyesight and can spot movement from miles away. Giant eagles are particularly protective of their nesting grounds and will attack any creature that threatens their young.
