Half-elves are the offspring of humans and elves. They are 30% resistant to sleep and charm spells. They have infravision to 60'. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and the languages of gnomes, halflings, orcs, hobgoblins, gnolls, and goblins. They can use any weapons and armor. They can be of any class, and can advance to high levels in multiple classes. They live in both human and elven communities, often serving as intermediaries between the two races. They have the appearance of slender humans with slightly pointed ears and fine features. They live longer than humans but not as long as elves, with a lifespan of about 250 years.
