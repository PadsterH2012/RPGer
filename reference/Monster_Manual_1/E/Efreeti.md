Efreet (singular: efreeti) are powerful fire spirits from the Elemental Plane of Fire. They appear as tall, muscular humanoids with red or black skin, glowing eyes, and small horns. They can carry up to 10,000 g.p. weight at their normal movement rate, and up to 20,000 g.p. weight at half speed. They can create food and water, as well as create objects of metal (including precious metals) which last for 1 day. They can create soft goods and wooden objects which are permanent. They can turn themselves into a pillar of flame 3' wide at the base, 6' wide at the top, and 12' tall. The flame does 2-16 hit points of damage to all within it, and ignites combustible materials. They can become invisible, assume gaseous form, and detect invisible objects at will. They can use the following spell-like powers once per day: enlarged, polymorph self, conjure an illusion (as the 3rd level magic-user spell phantasmal force, but the illusion remains as long as the efreeti maintains concentration), create a wall of fire, and produce flame. They can also use the plane shift spell to travel to any elemental plane, the Astral Plane, or the Material Plane. Efreet speak their own language, common, and the languages of all intelligent fire-dwelling creatures. They are proud and arrogant, and resent being summoned or commanded.
