The eye of the deep is a beholder-like creature that dwells in deep water. It has a spherical body with a large central eye and two smaller eyes on the ends of 2' long tentacles. It also has two large crab-like pincers. It attacks with its pincers, which do 2-8 hit points of damage each, and its bite, which does 1-4 hit points of damage. Its central eye can emit a cone of light 6" long and 2" wide at the end. Any creature caught in this light must save versus petrification or be paralyzed for 5-20 rounds. Its smaller eyes can each emit a different ray once per round: one eye can cast a hold monster spell, and the other can cast a flesh to stone spell. The eye of the deep is found in deep ocean waters, where it preys on fish and other aquatic creatures. It is intelligent and malevolent, and will attack surface dwellers who venture into its territory. The eye of the deep can speak the common tongue and several other languages. It is a solitary creature, rarely interacting with others of its kind except to mate. The eye of the deep is particularly feared by sailors and other seafarers, as it can disable entire ships with its paralyzing light and then pick off the crew one by one with its other eye rays.
