The ear seeker is a tiny, worm-like creature which burrows into the ears of sleeping or helpless victims. Once inside, it lays eggs and then dies. The eggs hatch in 1-4 days, and the larvae begin to feed on the victim's brain. This causes deafness in the affected ear, and 1-4 hit points of damage per day. If not treated with a cure disease spell within 1-4 days, the victim will die. The ear seeker is found in rotting wood, and is often encountered in old, decaying furniture. They are particularly common in tropical and subtropical regions where humidity accelerates wood decay. Ear seekers are not intelligent and have no attacks other than their burrowing. They are attracted to the warmth and moisture of living creatures, particularly the ears of humanoids. They are too small to be effectively fought with weapons, and must be removed with magic or careful extraction. Even if removed, the damage they cause may be permanent without magical healing.
