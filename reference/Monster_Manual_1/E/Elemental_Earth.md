These powerful creatures travel rather slowly, and in order to cross water they must travel through the ground and go under the bed of the body of water (possibly a long trip). They score full damage against any creature which rests on the earth, -2 on each die of damage against other opponents (flying, levitating, etc.). Against constructions built on stone or earth they act as a super battering ram, causing 2-8 points of structural damage (a typical cottage having about 7 structural points). They can be summoned from earth or stone.

On the elemental plane of earth there exists a boss rumored to be of astounding size.
