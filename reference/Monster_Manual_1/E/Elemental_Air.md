Air elementals appear as swirling clouds of air and dust. They attack by striking with their fists, which do 2-16 (small), 2-20 (medium), or 3-24 (large) hit points of damage. They can also form themselves into a whirlwind 3" wide at the base, 6" wide at the top, and 2"/HD tall. The whirlwind does damage equal to the elemental's normal attack, and can sweep away creatures with fewer than 2 HD. Air elementals can only be hit by weapons of +2 or better enchantment. They can be harmed by earth-based attacks, but are immune to air-based attacks. They can fly, and can travel over water and earth at their normal movement rate. Air elementals are particularly effective against flying creatures, gaining a +1 to hit against them.

Air elementals are constantly in motion, swirling and shifting. They are the fastest of the elementals and the most difficult to contain. They can slip through small cracks and openings as long as there is air on the other side. Air elementals are vulnerable to earth-based attacks and take double damage from such attacks. They cannot enter water, as this disrupts their form. Air elementals are particularly fond of high places and open skies, and become agitated if confined in small spaces. They can sense air currents and can detect the presence of other air-based creatures within 100 feet.
