Elves are slender, graceful demihumans with pointed ears and delicate features. They are skilled in magic, archery, and stealth. They have infravision to 60', and can detect secret and hidden doors on a 1-2 on a d6 (1 on a d6 if just passing by). They are 90% resistant to sleep and charm spells. They gain a +1 bonus to hit with bows and swords. Elves typically live in forests, where they build beautiful cities that blend with the natural environment. They are excellent craftsmen, especially with wood, cloth, and magic. They are very long-lived, with a lifespan of 1,200 years or more. Elves speak their own language, gnome, halfling, goblin, hobgoblin, orc, and the common tongue.

Elves are known for their love of nature, art, and magic. They are generally peaceful, but will defend their forests fiercely if threatened. Elves are skilled in both magic and combat, with many being proficient in both. They prefer to use hit-and-run tactics, using their stealth and archery skills to great effect. Elves have a natural enmity toward orcs, goblins, and other evil humanoids, and will often go out of their way to fight these creatures. Elves are sometimes viewed as aloof or arrogant by other races, but they are generally friendly toward those who respect nature and show good intentions.
