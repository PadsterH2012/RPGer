Ettins are large, two-headed humanoids with orcish features. They attack with two large clubs, one wielded by each head. Because they have two heads, ettins are difficult to surprise, and are only surprised on a roll of 1 on a d6. They can also keep watch in all directions, making it impossible to sneak up on them from behind. Ettins are found in hills, mountains, and underground. They live in caves or ruins, and are active primarily at night. They are not intelligent, but are cunning fighters. They speak their own language, which is a mixture of orc and giant, and sometimes the common tongue. Ettins are solitary creatures, rarely forming groups larger than a mated pair and their offspring. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack anything that enters their domain. Ettins are particularly feared for their ability to wield two weapons simultaneously, making them formidable opponents in combat. Their dual nature also makes them resistant to spells that affect the mind, as both heads must be affected for the spell to work.
