# ELEMENTAL

There are four different kinds of elementals normally encountered - air, earth, fire, and water elementals. These are strong but relatively stupid beings conjured magically from their normal habitat - the elemental planes of air, earth, etc. The strength of any type varies, and the characteristics of each elemental type are different. All differences will be dealt with separately under the appropriate headings.

More or less powerful and/or intelligent elementals exist on the elemental planes than can be summoned. Various forms of free-willed elemental plane dwellers will be found described elsewhere in this book. The outstanding true elementals dwelling on these planes will be mentioned only briefly hereunder.

Conjured elementals fall into three hit dice strength categories, and this applies to all types:

Conjured by spell | 16 hit dice
Conjured by summoning device | 12 hit dice
Conjured through a staff | 8 hit dice

Any creature conjuring an elemental may do so but once per day per means per elemental type. For example a magic-user with two appropriate staffs could summon at least two elementals, one through each staff, once per day, each. Both elementals could not be the same kind. If the magic-user were able to employ several spells to conjure elementals, each spell would have to summon a different kind of elemental. However, if the magic-user also had a summoning device and a staff he could possibly evoke three elementals of the same type.

As elementals are stupid and resent being summoned, the conjuring party must concentrate upon controlling the creature. Failure to do so will result in the elemental turning upon the summoner 75% of the time and attacking. The turning elemental will come directly towards the conjuring party, attacking anything in its path along the way. Control can never be regained, and an uncontrolled elemental will always return to its own plane in three turns after control is lost. If an elemental does not turn (25% chance). it simply goes immediately to its own plane. Control concentration requires that the summoning party remain stationary and be neither physically nor mentally attacked, including attack by missile or distraction. In any event, only one elemental at a time can be controlled.

Elementals are impervious to attacks by normal weapons and even magical weapons under +2 bonus. Creatures without magical ability of some sort cannot harm elementals unless the creatures have four or more hit dice. Magical ability includes paralysis, poison, acid, breath weapons, and even the characteristic of not being subject to attack by normal weapons. Kobolds, goblins, orcs, etc. are all powerless to affect elementals because they have neither magical property nor four or more hit dice. Ogres, however, could attack an elemental with effect as they have the necessary strength (four hit dice in this case). Note, however, that if a kobold with a +2 magic sword attacked an elemental the weapon would be effective.

A conjured elemental can be taken over and controlled by a magic-user casting a dispel magic spell (ratio dispeller's level over conjuring party's level to determine chance of success), and deliberately aiming it at dispelling the control rather than the elemental. However, if the spell fails, the effect is to strengthen the elemental to a full 8 points per hit die, double the controller's ability to concentrate, and make the elemental resent the one attempting the take-over, so that if it becomes uncontrolled it will go after that magic-user.
