Drow, or dark elves, are a subrace of elves who live deep underground. They have black skin, white hair, and red eyes. They have all the abilities of normal elves, plus 120' infravision and a natural magic resistance of 50%. They are also immune to sleep and charm spells. Drow can use the following spell-like powers once per day: dancing lights, faerie fire, and darkness. Drow are skilled in the use of poison, which they often apply to their weapons. They are cruel, treacherous, and evil. They worship the demon queen Lolth, and their society is dominated by priestesses of Lolth. They are enemies of all surface races, especially other elves. Drow speak their own language, the common tongue, and can communicate with most subterranean creatures.

Drow society is matriarchal, with females holding the highest positions of power. Male drow can become powerful wizards, but they are always subservient to the priestesses of Lolth. Drow are known for their cruelty and their willingness to betray even their closest allies to gain advantage. They are masters of stealth and ambush, preferring to attack from the shadows rather than engage in open combat. Drow are particularly vulnerable to sunlight, which blinds them temporarily and causes them discomfort. They are skilled crafters of magic items, especially those that enhance their natural abilities or protect them from their weaknesses.
