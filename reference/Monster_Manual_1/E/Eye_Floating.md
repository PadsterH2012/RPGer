Floating eyes are small, spherical creatures consisting of a central eye surrounded by smaller eyestalks. They have no physical attacks, but can use various spell-like powers through their eyestalks. Each floating eye has 1-4 of the following powers, which it can use once per round: charm person, sleep, telekinesis (250 g.p. weight), cause fear, and cause serious wounds. Floating eyes are found in dungeons and ruins, where they serve more powerful creatures as scouts and guards. They are not aggressive, and will generally flee if attacked. Floating eyes can see in all directions simultaneously, making it impossible to surprise them. They can also see invisible creatures. Floating eyes communicate telepathically with each other and with their masters. They are often used by beholders and other eye tyrants as servants and spies. Floating eyes are particularly vulnerable to physical attacks, having very little in the way of natural defenses. They rely on their spell-like powers and their ability to flee quickly to avoid danger.
