Elephants are huge, herbivorous mammals with thick, gray skin, large ears, and long tusks. They attack with their tusks, feet, and trunk. If they can charge for at least 30', they gain a +2 bonus to hit and do double damage with their tusks. They can also trample opponents, which requires a separate attack roll and does 4-32 hit points of damage. Elephants are found in warm forests and plains. Their tusks are valuable, worth 100-600 gold pieces each. Elephants have excellent memories and can remember routes to water and food sources for many years.

Elephants are social animals that live in herds led by a matriarch. They are intelligent for animals and can be trained to perform various tasks. Elephants are herbivores, feeding on grass, leaves, bark, and fruit. They require large amounts of food and water daily. Elephants are known for their strong family bonds and will defend their young fiercely. They communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, many of which are too low-pitched for humans to hear. Elephants are sometimes used as mounts or beasts of burden in warmer climates, though they require specialized training and handling.
