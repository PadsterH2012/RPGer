Weretigers are lycanthropes who can transform into tigers or tiger-humanoid hybrids. In human form, they appear as lithe, graceful humans with feline features and movements. In tiger form, they appear as large tigers with unusually intelligent eyes. In hybrid form, they appear as humanoid tigers with powerful claws and fangs.

Weretigers are typically solitary creatures, living in wilderness areas far from human settlements. They are stealthy and cunning, preferring to hunt from ambush rather than engage in direct confrontation. They are particularly protective of their territory and will defend it against intruders. Weretigers are often found in the company of normal tigers, which they can communicate with and control.

In combat, weretigers attack with their powerful claws and bite. They are skilled in ambush tactics and can surprise opponents on a roll of 1-4 on a d6. Weretigers can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to normal weapons and to most spells. They are vulnerable to wolfsbane, which causes them to flee if they fail a saving throw.

Weretigers are known for their grace and agility, and they can move silently and hide in shadows with great skill. They are also known for their patience and cunning, and they will often stalk their prey for hours before striking. Weretigers are not inherently evil, but their predatory nature and territorial behavior often bring them into conflict with humans and other intelligent creatures.

Weretigers are sometimes found in the service of powerful individuals or organizations, who value their stealth and combat abilities. They may also be found in the company of other neutral-aligned lycanthropes, such as wereboars, with whom they share a mutual respect. Weretigers are particularly feared in areas where tigers are common, as they can easily blend in with the local wildlife.
