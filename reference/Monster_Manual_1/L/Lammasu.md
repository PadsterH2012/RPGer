The lammasu is a noble creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human male. It has large, feathered wings growing from its shoulders. It attacks with its front claws, each of which does 1-6 hit points of damage. It can also use the following spell-like powers: detect evil, detect magic, detect invisibility, and protection from evil in a 6" radius. It can use the following spells as a 6th level cleric: cure light wounds, cure disease, neutralize poison, remove fear, and remove curse. It can only be hit by weapons of +1 or better enchantment. Lammasu are guardians of good and law, and will aid good-aligned beings in need. They are often found in ancient ruins, temples, and other places of power. They are intelligent and wise, and can speak the common tongue and several other languages. Lammasu can sense the alignment of creatures they encounter and will attack evil beings on sight. They are particularly opposed to rakshasas and other evil shapechangers. Lammasu mate for life and typically produce one offspring every five years. Young lammasu reach maturity after two years.
