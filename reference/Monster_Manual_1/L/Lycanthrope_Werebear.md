Werebears are lycanthropes who can transform into bears or bear-humanoid hybrids. In human form, they appear as large, muscular humans with hairy bodies. In bear form, they appear as large bears with unusually intelligent eyes. In hybrid form, they appear as humanoid bears with powerful claws and jaws.

Werebears are typically solitary creatures, living in wilderness areas far from human settlements. They are generally peaceful and avoid conflict, but they can be fierce fighters when provoked. They are particularly protective of their territory and will defend it against intruders. Werebears are often found in the company of normal bears, which they can communicate with and control.

In combat, werebears attack with their powerful claws and bite. If both claw attacks hit the same opponent in the same round, the werebear can hug for an additional 2-16 points of damage. Werebears can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to normal weapons and to most spells. They are vulnerable to wolfsbane, which causes them to flee if they fail a saving throw.

Werebears are unique among lycanthropes in that they can use their powers to heal others. Once per day, a werebear can cure 2-8 points of damage by touch. This ability can only be used in bear or hybrid form. Werebears are also known for their great strength and endurance, and they can continue fighting even when severely wounded.

Werebears are often respected by wilderness communities for their wisdom and protective nature. They sometimes serve as guardians of forests or mountains, defending them against evil creatures and destructive humans. Despite their good alignment, werebears are still feared by many humans due to their lycanthropic nature and their fearsome appearance in bear form.
