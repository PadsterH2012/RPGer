Wereboars are lycanthropes who can transform into boars or boar-humanoid hybrids. In human form, they appear as stocky, muscular humans with bristly hair and sometimes small tusks. In boar form, they appear as large, fierce boars with unusually intelligent eyes. In hybrid form, they appear as humanoid boars with powerful tusks and cloven hooves.

Wereboars are typically found in small groups in wilderness areas, particularly forests and hills. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders who enter their domain. They are particularly hostile towards werewolves, with whom they have a long-standing enmity. Wereboars are often found in the company of normal boars, which they can communicate with and control.

In combat, wereboars attack with their powerful tusks, which can gore for significant damage. If severely wounded, wereboars can enter a berserk rage, gaining a +2 bonus to hit but suffering a -2 penalty to their armor class. Wereboars can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to normal weapons and to most spells. They are vulnerable to wolfsbane, which causes them to flee if they fail a saving throw.

Wereboars are known for their great strength and endurance, and they can continue fighting even when severely wounded. They are also known for their stubbornness and determination, and they will rarely retreat from a fight once it has begun. Wereboars are not inherently evil, but their aggressive nature and territorial behavior often bring them into conflict with humans and other intelligent creatures.

Wereboars are sometimes found in the service of evil humanoids, such as orcs or hobgoblins, who value their strength and ferocity in battle. They may also be found in the company of other neutral-aligned lycanthropes, such as weretigers, with whom they share a mutual respect.
