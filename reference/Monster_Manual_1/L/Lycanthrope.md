# LYCANTHROPE

Lycanthropes are humans who can transform themselves into animals or animal-humanoid hybrids. There are several types of lycanthropes, each named for the animal form they can assume: werebears, wereboars, wererats, weretigers, and werewolves. All lycanthropes have three forms: human, animal, and hybrid. In human form, they appear completely normal, though they may display some behavioral traits associated with their animal type. In animal form, they appear as larger, more powerful versions of normal animals. In hybrid form, they appear as humanoid creatures with pronounced animal features.

Lycanthropes can be divided into two groups: natural lycanthropes, who are born with the condition, and afflicted lycanthropes, who acquire it by being wounded by another lycanthrope. Natural lycanthropes can control their transformations, changing form at will, while afflicted lycanthropes transform involuntarily under certain conditions, such as the full moon or extreme stress. Natural lycanthropes are immune to the effects of silver weapons, while afflicted lycanthropes are vulnerable to them.

All lycanthropes are immune to normal weapons, and can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They have enhanced senses, including the ability to detect approaching enemies, and they can communicate with normal animals of their type. They are vulnerable to wolfsbane, which causes them to flee if they fail a saving throw. Lycanthropy can be cured by a cure disease spell cast by a cleric of at least 12th level, but only if the afflicted individual has been a lycanthrope for less than a certain amount of time, which varies by type.

Lycanthropes are often feared and hunted by human communities, due to the danger they pose and the difficulty in identifying them in human form. Some types of lycanthropes, such as werewolves, are typically evil and predatory, while others, such as werebears, are often good-aligned and may even protect human communities from other threats.
