Wererats are lycanthropes who can transform into giant rats or rat-humanoid hybrids. In human form, they appear as thin, wiry humans with sharp features and nervous mannerisms. In rat form, they appear as large rats with unusually intelligent eyes. In hybrid form, they appear as humanoid rats with sharp claws and teeth.

Wererats are typically found in urban areas, living in sewers, abandoned buildings, or other hidden locations. They are organized into tight-knit groups or clans, each led by a powerful wererat leader. They are secretive and cunning, preferring stealth and trickery to direct confrontation. Wererats are often found in the company of normal rats and giant rats, which they can communicate with and control.

In combat, wererats attack with their sharp teeth or with weapons. They are skilled in ambush tactics and can surprise opponents on a roll of 1-4 on a d6. Wererats can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to normal weapons and to most spells. They are vulnerable to wolfsbane, which causes them to flee if they fail a saving throw.

Wererats are known for their intelligence and cunning, and they often engage in complex schemes and plots. They are also known for their stealth and agility, and they can move silently and hide in shadows with great skill. Wererats are inherently evil and often prey on humans and other intelligent creatures, either for food or for other nefarious purposes.

Wererats are sometimes found in the service of evil humanoids or other evil creatures, who value their stealth and cunning. They may also be found in the company of other evil-aligned lycanthropes, such as werewolves, with whom they share a mutual respect. Wererats are particularly feared in urban areas, where their ability to blend in with human society makes them difficult to detect and eliminate.
