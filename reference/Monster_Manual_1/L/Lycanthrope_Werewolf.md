Werewolves are lycanthropes who can transform into wolves or wolf-humanoid hybrids. In human form, they appear as normal humans, though they may have slightly feral features. In wolf form, they appear as large wolves with unusually intelligent eyes. In hybrid form, they appear as humanoid wolves with powerful jaws and claws.

Werewolves are typically found in small packs in wilderness areas, particularly forests and hills. They are aggressive and predatory, and will often hunt humans and other intelligent creatures for food. They are particularly hostile towards werebears, with whom they have a long-standing enmity. Werewolves are often found in the company of normal wolves, which they can communicate with and control.

In combat, werewolves attack with their powerful jaws, which can tear flesh and crush bone. They are skilled in pack tactics and will often surround and overwhelm their prey. Werewolves can only be hit by silver or magical weapons. They are immune to normal weapons and to most spells. They are vulnerable to wolfsbane, which causes them to flee if they fail a saving throw.

Werewolves are known for their ferocity and bloodlust, and they can enter a frenzy when they smell blood or when they are severely wounded. They are also known for their endurance and determination, and they will often pursue their prey for miles without tiring. Werewolves are inherently evil and often prey on humans and other intelligent creatures, either for food or for the sheer pleasure of causing pain and suffering.

Werewolves are sometimes found in the service of evil humanoids or other evil creatures, who value their ferocity and combat abilities. They may also be found in the company of other evil-aligned lycanthropes, such as wererats, with whom they share a mutual respect. Werewolves are particularly feared in rural areas, where their ability to blend in with the local wildlife makes them difficult to detect and eliminate.
