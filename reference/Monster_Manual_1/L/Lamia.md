The lamia is a creature with the upper body of a human female and the lower body of a beast, usually a lion. It attacks with its claws, which do 1-4 hit points of damage. It can also use the following spell-like powers at will: charm person, mirror image, suggestion, and illusion. Once per day, it can use dimension door. Its most feared attack, however, is its touch, which permanently drains 1 point of wisdom from the victim. This wisdom drain cannot be reversed except by a wish. The lamia feeds on the blood and flesh of humanoids, especially young humans. It uses its illusion powers to lure victims to its lair, which is often a ruined temple or palace in a desert or wilderness area. Lamias are intelligent and cunning, and enjoy tormenting their victims before killing them. They often keep charmed humanoids as servants and guards. Lamias can speak the common tongue and several other languages. They are solitary creatures but occasionally form alliances with other evil beings. Their touch leaves a silvery residue on the skin that can only be removed by a remove curse spell.
