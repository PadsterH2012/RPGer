Treants are intelligent, mobile tree-like creatures. They attack with their branch-like arms, each of which does 4-24 hit points of damage. They can also animate 2 normal trees within 6", causing them to fight as treants with 6 hit dice. Treants are vulnerable to fire, taking double damage from fire-based attacks. They are immune to lightning. Treants are found in deep forests, where they act as guardians of the trees. They are intelligent and benevolent, but are slow to make decisions and rarely interact with other races. They speak their own language, elvish, and the common tongue. Treants are particularly effective against creatures that threaten their forests, such as orcs, goblins, and other evil humanoids. They are excellent at blending in with normal trees, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls in forested environments. Treants are sometimes served by other forest creatures, who respect their connection to nature. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage. Treants are generally peaceful, but will defend their forests fiercely if threatened. They are known for their great strength and their ability to animate trees, which makes them formidable opponents in their home territory.
