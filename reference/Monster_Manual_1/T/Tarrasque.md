The tarrasque is a legendary monster of enormous size and power. It attacks with its two front claws, two rear claws, bite, and tail. It can also rush, which does 4-48 hit points of damage and has a 75% chance of knocking the victim down. If it scores a natural 20 on its attack roll with its bite, it swallows its victim whole. Swallowed creatures take 3-18 hit points of damage per round from digestive acids, and will die after 10 rounds. The tarrasque is immune to fire, heat, and all spells except wish. It can only be hit by weapons of at least +1 enchantment. It regenerates 1 hit point per round. The tarrasque can be killed only by reducing it to -30 or fewer hit points and then casting a wish spell on it. Otherwise, it will regenerate and return to life. The tarrasque is found in remote wilderness areas, where it sleeps for long periods, awakening only to feed. It is not intelligent, and relies on instinct to hunt and survive. It is particularly feared for its enormous size and power, which makes it capable of destroying entire cities. The tarrasque is immune to poison and most other effects that target living creatures, as it has a unique biology. It is particularly vulnerable to wish spells, which are the only way to permanently kill it. The tarrasque is sometimes worshipped as a god by primitive tribes, who make sacrifices to it in the hope of keeping it asleep.
