Tritons are aquatic humanoids with silvery skin, blue-green hair, and small fins on their arms and legs. They attack with various weapons, usually tridents, spears, or crossbows. They can also cast the following spell-like powers once per day: create water, detect magic, detect evil, detect invisible, and summon 1-4 giant sea horses, 1-4 hippocampi, or 1 giant sea snake. They can breathe both air and water, but must immerse themselves in water at least once per day or they will die. They can see in darkness up to 90'. Tritons are found in deep oceans, where they build cities of coral and other sea materials. They are intelligent and noble, and will aid good-aligned beings in need. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and can communicate with most intelligent aquatic creatures. Tritons are particularly effective against evil aquatic creatures, such as sahuagin and kraken, whom they oppose whenever possible. They are excellent swimmers and can navigate the darkest depths with ease. Tritons are sometimes served by giant sea horses, hippocampi, or other aquatic creatures, who respect their wisdom and power. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage. Tritons are generally peaceful, but will defend their underwater realms fiercely if threatened.
