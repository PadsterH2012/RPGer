The thought eater is a strange creature that exists primarily on the Ethereal Plane. It appears as a skeletal, platypus-like creature with a large, bulbous cranium. It attacks by draining the intelligence of its victim, which it does by touching the victim's head. This drains 1d6 points of intelligence, which return at a rate of 1 point per day. If a victim's intelligence is reduced to 0, they die. Thought eaters can only be hit by magical weapons or psionic attacks. They are immune to all mind-affecting spells. They can become ethereal at will, and are invisible on the Material Plane unless a detect invisible or true seeing spell is used. Thought eaters are found on the Ethereal Plane, where they hunt for intelligent prey. They are intelligent and cunning, and will often stalk their prey for hours before attacking. They speak no languages, but can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. Thought eaters are particularly feared for their ability to drain intelligence, which can render even the most powerful spellcaster helpless. They are excellent at hiding on the Ethereal Plane, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls. Thought eaters are sometimes used as guardians by more powerful psionic creatures, who can control them through mental domination. They are particularly vulnerable to psionic attacks, which they have no special defense against.
