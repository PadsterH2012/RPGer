Titans are enormous humanoids of godlike power. They attack with huge weapons, usually a two-handed sword or club, which do 7-42 hit points of damage. They can also cast spells as a 15th level magic-user and a 15th level cleric. They can use the following spell-like powers at will: alter self, animal summoning, bless, cause light wounds, cure light wounds, detect evil, detect magic, detect invisibility, ESP, fear, feather fall, fly, levitate, light, protection from evil, protection from normal missiles, purify food and drink, read languages, read magic, remove curse, remove fear, tongues, and water breathing. Once per day, they can use the following spell-like powers: commune, conjure elemental, control weather, cure disease, dispel evil, dispel magic, earthquake, hold monster, and regenerate. Titans have a natural magic resistance of 70%. They are immune to all poisons and diseases. Titans are found in remote mountains, clouds, or other inaccessible places. They are intelligent and benevolent, and will aid good-aligned beings in need. They speak their own language, the common tongue, and several other languages. Titans are particularly effective against evil creatures, whom they can detect at a distance of up to 9". They are excellent flyers despite their great weight due to their magical nature. Titans are sometimes served by other good-aligned creatures, who respect their wisdom and power. They are particularly vulnerable to cold iron weapons, which ignore their magic resistance.
