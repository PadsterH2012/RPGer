Trolls are tall, thin humanoids with rubbery, moss-green skin and long, gangly limbs. They attack with their claws and bite. Their most feared ability, however, is their regeneration. Trolls regenerate 3 hit points per round, and can even regrow severed limbs. The only way to permanently kill a troll is to burn it or immerse it in acid. Trolls are found in wilderness areas, ruins, and underground caverns. They are not very intelligent, but are cunning fighters. They are aggressive and territorial, and will attack intruders on sight. Trolls speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. Trolls are particularly feared for their regeneration ability, which makes them nearly impossible to kill without fire or acid. They are excellent at hiding in rocky terrain, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls in such environments. Trolls are sometimes served by dire wolves or other predatory creatures, which they train as hunting beasts and guards. They are particularly vulnerable to fire and acid, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage. Trolls are generally hostile to all other races, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are particularly fond of human flesh, and will often keep prisoners to devour later.
