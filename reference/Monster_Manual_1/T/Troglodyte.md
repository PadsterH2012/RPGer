Troglodytes are reptilian humanoids with chameleon-like skin and a foul odor. They attack with their claws and bite. They also emit a nauseating stench in a 10' radius. Any creature within this radius must save versus poison or be nauseated, suffering a -2 penalty to attack rolls. Troglodytes can change color to match their surroundings, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls. Troglodytes are found in underground caverns and tunnels. They are intelligent and malevolent, and enjoy tormenting and killing other creatures. They speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. Troglodytes are particularly feared for their nauseating stench and their ability to blend into their surroundings, which makes them effective ambush predators. They are excellent at hiding in rocky terrain, gaining a +4 bonus to surprise rolls in such environments. Troglodytes are sometimes served by giant lizards or other reptilian creatures, which they train as hunting beasts and guards. They are particularly vulnerable to fire, which they fear, and clever adventurers can often use this to their advantage. Troglodytes are generally hostile to all other races, and will rarely negotiate or show mercy. They are particularly fond of human flesh, and will often keep prisoners to devour later.
