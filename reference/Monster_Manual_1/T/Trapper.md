The trapper is a strange creature that resembles a large, flat surface, such as a floor, ceiling, or wall. It can change its coloration to match any stone surface, making it 90% undetectable. It attacks by wrapping itself around its prey, which it does when a creature steps on it. The victim is then constricted for 1-8 hit points of damage per round and begins to suffocate, dying in 6 rounds unless freed. The trapper can sense vibrations through stone up to 90 feet away, allowing it to detect the approach of potential prey. Trappers are found in dungeons and caves, where they wait for prey to step on them. They are intelligent and cunning, and will often position themselves in places where adventurers are likely to walk, such as at the end of a corridor or in a treasure room. Trappers speak their own language and sometimes the common tongue. They are particularly feared for their ability to disguise themselves as ordinary surfaces, which can lead to nasty surprises for unwary adventurers. There are two types of trappers: the standard trapper described above, which mimics floors, and the lurker above, which mimics ceilings. Both types are dangerous predators that should be approached with caution.
