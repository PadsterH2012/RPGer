# Mapping

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Mapping is a crucial aspect of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, providing visual representation of the campaign world and the specific locations where adventures take place. This section provides detailed information on mapping and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on creating and using maps in the campaign.

## Types of Maps

There are several types of maps used in the AD&D game:

- **World Maps**: These show the overall geography of the campaign world, including continents, oceans, major mountain ranges, and other large-scale features. They typically use a small scale, such as 1 inch = 100 miles.
- **Regional Maps**: These show the geography of a specific region within the campaign world, including kingdoms, cities, forests, rivers, and other medium-scale features. They typically use a medium scale, such as 1 inch = 20 miles.
- **Local Maps**: These show the geography of a specific local area within the campaign world, including individual buildings, streets, fields, and other small-scale features. They typically use a large scale, such as 1 inch = 500 feet.
- **Dungeon Maps**: These show the layout of dungeons and other underground complexes, including rooms, corridors, doors, and other features. They typically use a very large scale, such as 1 inch = 10 feet.
- **Encounter Maps**: These show the specific area where an encounter takes place, including terrain features, obstacles, and the positions of creatures. They typically use the largest scale, such as 1 inch = 5 feet or 1 inch = 1 foot.

## Map Scales

The scale of a map determines how much physical space is represented by a given distance on the map:

- **Small Scale**: These maps cover large areas but show less detail. Examples include world maps (1 inch = 100 miles) and continental maps (1 inch = 50 miles).
- **Medium Scale**: These maps cover moderate areas and show moderate detail. Examples include regional maps (1 inch = 20 miles) and kingdom maps (1 inch = 10 miles).
- **Large Scale**: These maps cover small areas but show more detail. Examples include local maps (1 inch = 500 feet) and city maps (1 inch = 200 feet).
- **Very Large Scale**: These maps cover very small areas but show the most detail. Examples include dungeon maps (1 inch = 10 feet) and building maps (1 inch = 5 feet).

## Map Symbols

Maps use various symbols to represent different features:

- **Terrain Symbols**: These represent different types of terrain, such as mountains, hills, forests, plains, deserts, swamps, and bodies of water.
- **Settlement Symbols**: These represent different types of settlements, such as cities, towns, villages, and isolated buildings.
- **Route Symbols**: These represent different types of routes, such as roads, trails, rivers, and sea lanes.
- **Boundary Symbols**: These represent different types of boundaries, such as political borders, geographical features, and magical barriers.
- **Special Feature Symbols**: These represent various special features, such as ruins, dungeons, temples, and other points of interest.

## Creating Maps

The DM should consider the following factors when creating maps:

- **Purpose**: The purpose of the map determines its scale, detail, and content. For example, a world map used for campaign planning will be different from an encounter map used for a specific battle.
- **Accuracy**: The map should be accurate enough for its purpose, but it need not be perfectly precise. In fact, some inaccuracy can reflect the imperfect knowledge of the world that would exist in a medieval fantasy setting.
- **Readability**: The map should be clear and easy to read, with legible labels, distinct symbols, and appropriate use of color or shading.
- **Consistency**: The map should be consistent with other maps of the same area, with the established geography and history of the campaign world, and with the rules of the game.
- **Aesthetics**: The map should be visually appealing, with a style that enhances the fantasy atmosphere of the game.

## Player Mapping

In many AD&D campaigns, players create their own maps based on the DM's descriptions:

- **Dungeon Mapping**: As the party explores a dungeon, one player typically serves as the mapper, creating a map based on the DM's descriptions of rooms, corridors, doors, and other features.
- **Wilderness Mapping**: When traveling through wilderness areas, players may create or annotate maps to record their route, encountered features, and other information.
- **Map Accuracy**: The accuracy of player maps depends on the players' ability to interpret the DM's descriptions and to measure distances and directions correctly. Errors in player mapping can lead to interesting situations, such as the party becoming lost or discovering unexpected areas.
- **Mapping Challenges**: Various factors can make mapping more challenging, such as irregular room shapes, teleportation effects, rotating rooms, or magical darkness. These challenges can add an extra layer of complexity and excitement to exploration.

## Using Maps in the Game

The DM should consider the following factors when using maps in the game:

- **DM Maps vs. Player Maps**: The DM typically has more detailed and accurate maps than the players, reflecting the DM's omniscient perspective. The DM should be careful not to reveal information from their maps that the characters would not know.
- **Map Revelation**: The DM should reveal map information gradually as the characters explore, rather than showing the entire map at once. This maintains the mystery and excitement of exploration.
- **Map Acquisition**: Characters may acquire maps in-game through various means, such as purchasing them from cartographers, finding them in treasure hoards, or receiving them from NPCs. These maps may be accurate, partially accurate, or deliberately misleading.
- **Map Reading Skills**: In a medieval fantasy setting, map reading would be a specialized skill. The DM may require Intelligence checks or similar rolls for characters to interpret complex or unfamiliar maps.
- **Magical Mapping**: Various magical effects, such as the wizard eye spell or a crystal ball, can aid in mapping by providing information about areas the characters have not physically explored.

## Special Mapping Considerations

Certain environments or situations present special mapping considerations:

- **Three-Dimensional Mapping**: Some environments, such as multi-level dungeons, underwater locations, or aerial settings, require three-dimensional mapping. This can be challenging to represent on two-dimensional paper.
- **Non-Euclidean Spaces**: Magical or extraplanar locations may not follow the normal rules of geometry, with spaces that are larger on the inside than the outside, rooms that connect in impossible ways, or corridors that loop back on themselves.
- **Changing Environments**: Some environments may change over time, due to natural processes, creature activities, or magical effects. The DM should update maps to reflect these changes.
- **Hidden Features**: Many maps include hidden features, such as secret doors, concealed passages, or invisible barriers. The DM should note these on their maps but not reveal them to players until the characters discover them.
- **Traps and Hazards**: Maps should indicate the locations of traps and hazards, but in a way that allows the DM to remember them without revealing them to the players prematurely.

## Conclusion

Mapping is a crucial aspect of the AD&D game, providing visual representation of the campaign world and the specific locations where adventures take place. The DM should create and use maps that enhance the game experience, providing clear information while maintaining the mystery and excitement of exploration. By considering the factors outlined in this section, the DM can create maps that are both functional tools for gameplay and evocative elements of the fantasy world.
