# Handling Player Characters

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Player characters (PCs) are the protagonists of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, and how the Dungeon Master (DM) handles them significantly affects the quality of the game experience. This section provides guidance for the DM on handling player characters effectively and creating a balanced and engaging game environment.

## Character Creation and Development

The DM plays a crucial role in character creation and development:

- **Creation Guidelines**: Establish clear guidelines for character creation, including allowed races, classes, alignments, and ability score generation methods, ensuring that characters fit the campaign setting and theme.
- **Background Integration**: Work with players to integrate their characters' backgrounds into the campaign world, creating connections to locations, NPCs, and historical events that can be developed during play.
- **Motivation Development**: Help players develop meaningful motivations for their characters, beyond simple treasure-hunting or monster-slaying, that can drive character development and engagement with the campaign.
- **Growth Opportunities**: Provide opportunities for character growth and development, including challenges that test the character's abilities, beliefs, and relationships.
- **Personal Quests**: Incorporate personal quests or storylines for each character, giving them individual goals and moments in the spotlight that reflect their unique backgrounds and motivations.

## Balancing Character Power

Maintaining balance among characters is essential for a fair and enjoyable game:

- **Ability Score Balance**: Ensure that ability scores are generated using a method that provides balanced results for all players, avoiding situations where some characters are significantly more powerful than others due to lucky rolls.
- **Class Balance**: Consider the relative power of different classes at different levels, and design adventures that allow each class to contribute meaningfully, regardless of their combat effectiveness.
- **Magical Item Distribution**: Distribute magical items thoughtfully, ensuring that all characters receive items that enhance their effectiveness and that no character becomes disproportionately powerful due to magical item accumulation.
- **Experience Point Management**: Manage experience point awards to maintain appropriate level progression and to keep characters at similar levels, avoiding situations where some characters significantly outpace others.
- **Challenge Calibration**: Calibrate challenges to the capabilities of the characters, providing appropriate difficulty that tests their abilities without being impossible or trivial.

## Character Death and Replacement

Character death is a possibility in the AD&D game, and the DM should handle it appropriately:

- **Fair Death**: Ensure that character death occurs as a result of fair challenges, player choices, and the luck of the dice, rather than arbitrary DM decisions or impossible situations.
- **Death Consequences**: Establish clear consequences for character death, including the possibility of resurrection, the loss of items or abilities, and the impact on the campaign story.
- **Replacement Characters**: Develop a system for introducing replacement characters when a character dies permanently, ensuring that new characters can integrate into the party and the campaign story smoothly.
- **Level Adjustment**: Determine an appropriate level for replacement characters, typically at or slightly below the level of the surviving characters, to maintain game balance while not overly penalizing the player.
- **Emotional Impact**: Respect the emotional impact that character death can have on players, allowing time for acknowledgment and closure before moving on with the game.

## Character Advancement

Character advancement is a key aspect of the AD&D game:

- **Experience Awards**: Award experience points consistently and fairly, based on challenges overcome, role-playing quality, and achievement of goals, rather than simply for combat victories.
- **Level-Up Process**: Establish a clear process for level advancement, including training requirements, time needed, and any costs or challenges involved.
- **New Abilities**: Help players understand and effectively use the new abilities their characters gain as they advance in level, ensuring that these abilities enhance the game experience rather than complicating or unbalancing it.
- **Character Evolution**: Encourage the evolution of characters as they advance, including changes in goals, relationships, and even alignment that reflect their experiences and growth.
- **High-Level Challenges**: Develop appropriate challenges for high-level characters that test their advanced abilities and provide meaningful goals beyond simple power accumulation.

## Player Agency and Character Autonomy

Respecting player agency and character autonomy is essential for an engaging game:

- **Decision Freedom**: Allow players the freedom to make decisions for their characters, even when those decisions might not align with the DM's expectations or planned story direction.
- **Consequence Implementation**: Implement logical consequences for character decisions, both positive and negative, that reflect the reality of the campaign world rather than punishing or rewarding specific choices.
- **Information Provision**: Provide players with the information their characters would reasonably have to make informed decisions, without withholding crucial details or overwhelming them with irrelevant information.
- **Autonomy Limits**: Establish clear limits on character autonomy when necessary for game functionality, such as restrictions on evil actions that would disrupt the party or campaign.
- **Player Input**: Seek and consider player input on aspects of the campaign that affect their characters, such as personal storylines, character development opportunities, or the introduction of new rules or settings.

## Managing Character Knowledge

The distinction between player knowledge and character knowledge is important:

- **Metagame Prevention**: Discourage metagaming, where players use knowledge that their characters wouldn't have to make decisions, while recognizing that some degree of metagaming is inevitable and not always problematic.
- **Information Sharing**: Establish expectations for how information is shared among characters, particularly when some characters have knowledge that others don't due to separate experiences or special abilities.
- **Secret Information**: Handle secret information carefully, such as through private notes or separate conversations, when characters have knowledge that should not be immediately shared with the entire party.
- **Character Expertise**: Respect character expertise based on their abilities, backgrounds, and experiences, allowing characters to know things that their players might not and vice versa.
- **Knowledge Checks**: Use ability checks or similar mechanics to determine what characters know or can figure out about specific situations, providing a fair and consistent method for resolving knowledge questions.

## Inter-Character Relationships

The relationships between characters significantly affect the game experience:

- **Party Formation**: Help players develop logical reasons for their characters to form and remain a party, beyond the meta-reason of being in the same game.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Establish methods for resolving conflicts between characters that allow for dramatic tension without disrupting the game or causing player discord.
- **Relationship Development**: Encourage the development of relationships between characters, including friendships, rivalries, romances, or mentorships, that add depth to the game and create opportunities for role-playing.
- **Group Dynamics**: Be aware of group dynamics and how they affect the game, addressing issues such as dominant characters, sidelined characters, or incompatible goals.
- **Party Cohesion**: Maintain party cohesion by providing common goals, shared threats, or mutual interests that give the characters reasons to work together despite their differences.

## Conclusion

Handling player characters effectively is one of the most important aspects of Dungeon Mastering. By considering character creation and development, balancing character power, managing death and replacement, facilitating advancement, respecting agency and autonomy, managing knowledge, and fostering inter-character relationships, the DM can create a game environment where characters thrive and players are engaged and invested in the campaign. Remember that the goal is not to control the characters or their development, but to provide a framework and opportunities for players to bring their characters to life in a meaningful and enjoyable way.
