# Handling Troublesome Players

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Even in the best-run ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS campaigns, troublesome player behaviors can arise that disrupt the game and diminish the enjoyment of other participants. This section provides guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on identifying and handling various types of troublesome players.

## Types of Troublesome Players

There are several common types of troublesome players that DMs may encounter:

- **The Rules Lawyer**: This player constantly argues about rules interpretations, challenges the DM's rulings, and may attempt to exploit loopholes or ambiguities in the rules to gain advantages.
- **The Power Gamer**: This player focuses exclusively on maximizing their character's power, often at the expense of role-playing, story engagement, or group cohesion.
- **The Spotlight Hog**: This player constantly seeks attention and tries to dominate play time, interrupting others, making unilateral decisions for the group, and ensuring their character is always at the center of the action.
- **The Disruptive Player**: This player engages in behaviors that disrupt the flow of the game, such as excessive joking, off-topic conversations, or deliberately derailing the adventure.
- **The Uncooperative Player**: This player refuses to work with the group, having their character act against the party's interests, withholding information or resources, or pursuing personal goals that conflict with the group's objectives.
- **The Metagamer**: This player uses out-of-character knowledge to influence in-character decisions, such as acting on information their character wouldn't know or making decisions based on game mechanics rather than character motivations.
- **The Absent or Unprepared Player**: This player frequently misses sessions, arrives late, leaves early, or comes to the game unprepared, requiring constant recaps and slowing down the game.

## Preventive Measures

The best way to handle troublesome players is to prevent problems before they arise:

- **Clear Expectations**: Establish clear expectations for behavior, play style, and campaign themes from the beginning, ensuring that all players understand and agree to these expectations.
- **Session Zero**: Hold a "session zero" before the campaign begins to discuss expectations, create characters collaboratively, and address any potential issues or concerns.
- **Group Compatibility**: Ensure that the players in the group have compatible play styles, interests, and expectations, as mismatches in these areas can lead to conflicts.
- **House Rules**: Establish clear house rules that address common issues, such as rules interpretations, player absence, or disruptive behavior, and ensure that all players understand and agree to these rules.
- **Regular Check-ins**: Periodically check in with players individually and as a group to address any emerging issues, gather feedback, and make adjustments as needed.

## General Approaches to Handling Troublesome Players

When dealing with troublesome players, the DM should consider the following general approaches:

- **Private Conversation**: Address issues privately with the troublesome player, rather than confronting them in front of the group. This allows for a more open and constructive discussion without public embarrassment.
- **Specific Feedback**: Provide specific feedback about the problematic behavior and its impact on the game and other players, rather than making general criticisms or personal attacks.
- **Active Listening**: Listen actively to the player's perspective and concerns, seeking to understand the underlying reasons for their behavior rather than simply condemning it.
- **Collaborative Solutions**: Work with the player to find solutions that address both their needs and the needs of the group, rather than imposing unilateral decisions.
- **Clear Consequences**: Establish clear consequences for continued problematic behavior, ensuring that the player understands what will happen if they do not change their behavior.
- **Consistent Enforcement**: Enforce rules and expectations consistently for all players, avoiding favoritism or selective enforcement that can create resentment.
- **Group Discussion**: For issues that affect the entire group, consider facilitating a group discussion to address the problem collectively, ensuring that all players have a voice in the solution.

## Specific Strategies for Different Types of Troublesome Players

Different types of troublesome players may require different handling strategies:

### The Rules Lawyer

- **Acknowledge Expertise**: Recognize the rules lawyer's knowledge of the rules, which can be a valuable asset when used constructively.
- **Establish Authority**: Make it clear that as DM, you have the final authority on rules interpretations in your campaign.
- **Defer Discussions**: For complex rules disputes, defer the discussion to after the session to avoid disrupting the game.
- **Consistent Rulings**: Strive for consistency in your rulings to reduce the frequency of disputes.
- **Collaborative Rule Clarification**: Work with the rules lawyer outside of game sessions to clarify ambiguous rules and establish how they will be handled in your campaign.

### The Power Gamer

- **Challenge Appropriately**: Design challenges that test more than just combat prowess or mechanical optimization, requiring creative thinking, role-playing, or cooperation.
- **Reward Role-Playing**: Provide incentives, such as experience points or inspiration, for good role-playing and character development.
- **Balance Spotlight**: Ensure that other characters have opportunities to shine, even if they are not as mechanically optimized.
- **Discuss Motivations**: Talk with the power gamer about their character's motivations and goals beyond power accumulation, encouraging deeper character development.
- **Mechanical Consequences**: Ensure that the character's power-focused choices have logical in-game consequences, both positive and negative.

### The Spotlight Hog

- **Active Moderation**: Actively moderate player participation, calling on quieter players and gently redirecting the spotlight hog when they have dominated too much time.
- **Split Focus**: Occasionally split the party or create situations that specifically engage other characters, giving them dedicated spotlight time.
- **Private Feedback**: Provide private feedback to the spotlight hog about the importance of sharing play time and allowing others to contribute.
- **Structured Turns**: Implement more structured turn-taking in certain situations to ensure all players have equal opportunities to participate.
- **Redirect Energy**: Channel the spotlight hog's energy into constructive contributions, such as helping to engage quieter players or taking on organizational responsibilities.

### The Disruptive Player

- **Clear Boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries about acceptable behavior during the game, including when joking or off-topic conversation is appropriate.
- **Engagement Strategies**: Find ways to engage the disruptive player more deeply in the game, addressing possible boredom or disconnection that may be causing the disruptive behavior.
- **Break Time**: Designate specific break times for socializing and off-topic conversation, making it clear when it's time to refocus on the game.
- **Consequence System**: Implement a system of warnings and consequences for disruptive behavior, applied consistently and fairly.
- **Alternative Activities**: If the player is consistently disruptive, consider whether they might be better suited to a different type of game or activity that better matches their interests and energy level.

### The Uncooperative Player

- **Character Integration**: Work with the player to better integrate their character's goals and motivations with the group's objectives, finding ways to align their interests.
- **Group Contract**: Establish a "group contract" that outlines expectations for cooperation and group dynamics, which all players agree to follow.
- **In-Game Consequences**: Allow natural in-game consequences for uncooperative behavior, such as reduced assistance from other characters or negative reactions from NPCs.
- **Alternative Expression**: Find alternative ways for the player to express their character's individuality or pursue personal goals without undermining the group.
- **Character Reassessment**: If the character concept is fundamentally incompatible with group play, discuss the possibility of creating a new character that better fits the campaign.

### The Metagamer

- **Information Control**: Control the information you provide to players, separating player knowledge from character knowledge more clearly.
- **Character Perspective**: Encourage the player to think from their character's perspective, considering what the character would actually know and how they would realistically react.
- **In-Game Consequences**: Implement in-game consequences for actions that seem based on metagame knowledge, such as NPCs becoming suspicious of inexplicable knowledge or actions.
- **Alternative Challenges**: Design challenges that cannot be easily overcome with metagame knowledge, requiring genuine problem-solving or role-playing.
- **Reward Authentic Play**: Provide incentives for playing authentically from the character's perspective, even when it might not be the optimal choice mechanically.

### The Absent or Unprepared Player

- **Clear Attendance Policy**: Establish a clear policy on attendance, including how absences will be handled in-game and what notice is expected.
- **Character Management**: Develop a system for managing the characters of absent players, such as having another player control the character or having the character fade into the background.
- **Session Summaries**: Provide session summaries to help absent players catch up, but make it their responsibility to review these before the next session.
- **Scheduling Tools**: Use scheduling tools or apps to find times that work for all players and to send reminders about upcoming sessions.
- **Preparation Guidance**: Provide guidance on what preparation is expected before each session, and consider providing resources or aids to help players prepare more efficiently.

## When to Ask a Player to Leave

In some cases, despite the DM's best efforts, it may be necessary to ask a troublesome player to leave the group:

- **Persistent Problems**: The player's problematic behavior persists despite multiple discussions, feedback, and opportunities to change.
- **Severe Disruption**: The player's behavior severely disrupts the game or causes significant distress to other players.
- **Incompatible Expectations**: The player's expectations or play style is fundamentally incompatible with the group, despite attempts to find common ground.
- **Toxic Behavior**: The player engages in toxic behavior, such as harassment, bullying, or deliberate sabotage of the game.
- **Group Consensus**: There is a consensus among the other players and the DM that the group would function better without the troublesome player.

When asking a player to leave, the DM should do so respectfully and privately, explaining the reasons clearly but without personal attacks, and allowing the player to leave with dignity.

## Conclusion

Handling troublesome players is one of the most challenging aspects of Dungeon Mastering, requiring a combination of clear communication, fair judgment, and interpersonal skills. By understanding the different types of troublesome players, implementing preventive measures, and applying appropriate handling strategies, the DM can address problems effectively and maintain a positive and enjoyable game experience for all participants. Remember that the goal is not to "win" against troublesome players, but to help them become constructive contributors to the game or, if necessary, to find a gaming environment better suited to their needs and play style.
