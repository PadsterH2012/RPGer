# Time

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Time is a fundamental element of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, providing structure for activities, movement, and the progression of events in the campaign world. This section provides detailed information on time measurement and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling time in the campaign.

## Time Measurement

The AD&D game uses several units of time measurement:

- **Segment**: The smallest unit of time, equal to 6 seconds. There are 10 segments in a round.
- **Round**: A unit of time equal to 1 minute (60 seconds), used primarily for combat and other detailed activities.
- **Turn**: A unit of time equal to 10 minutes (10 rounds), used primarily for exploration and other less detailed activities.
- **Hour**: A unit of time equal to 60 minutes (6 turns), used for travel, rest, and other extended activities.
- **Day**: A unit of time equal to 24 hours, used for long-distance travel, recovery, and campaign timekeeping.
- **Week**: A unit of time equal to 7 days, used for extended activities and campaign timekeeping.
- **Month**: A unit of time equal to 30 days (or as determined by the campaign calendar), used for long-term activities and campaign timekeeping.
- **Year**: A unit of time equal to 12 months (or as determined by the campaign calendar), used for campaign history and character aging.

## Time in Combat

Time in combat is measured primarily in rounds and segments:

- **Round**: A combat round represents 1 minute of time, during which each participant can typically perform one main action (such as attacking, casting a spell, or using an item) and various minor actions (such as speaking briefly or drawing a weapon).
- **Segment**: A segment represents 6 seconds of time, and is used to determine the precise timing of actions within a round, particularly for spell casting and initiative.
- **Initiative**: Initiative determines the order in which participants act within a round. It is typically determined by rolling a d6, with lower numbers acting first. Various factors, such as weapon speed, spell casting time, and dexterity, can modify initiative.
- **Action Timing**: Different actions take different amounts of time to complete. For example, most attacks take 1 round, while spell casting can take from 1 segment to several rounds, depending on the spell.

## Time in Exploration

Time in exploration is measured primarily in turns:

- **Turn**: An exploration turn represents 10 minutes of time, during which characters can typically move a certain distance, search an area, or perform other exploration activities.
- **Movement**: Characters can move a certain distance per turn, depending on their movement rate and the terrain. For example, a character with a movement rate of 12" can move 120 feet per turn in a dungeon.
- **Searching**: Searching an area typically takes 1 turn per 10' Ã— 10' area. This includes looking for secret doors, hidden treasures, or other concealed features.
- **Rest**: Characters typically need to rest for 1 turn after every 5 turns of exploration or similar activity. Failure to rest results in penalties to combat and other activities.

## Time in Travel

Time in travel is measured primarily in hours and days:

- **Hourly Movement**: Characters can move a certain distance per hour, depending on their movement rate and the terrain. For example, a character with a movement rate of 12" can move 12 miles per hour on a road.
- **Daily Movement**: Characters can typically travel for 8 hours per day before needing extended rest. This results in a daily movement distance of 8 times the hourly movement rate.
- **Forced March**: Characters can travel for more than 8 hours per day by making a forced march, but this results in fatigue and requires Constitution checks to avoid penalties.
- **Rest and Recovery**: Characters typically need 8 hours of sleep per day to avoid fatigue. They also need time for meals, setting up and breaking camp, and other daily activities.

## Time and Resources

The passage of time affects various resources:

- **Food and Water**: Characters consume food and water over time. A typical character needs 1 pound of food and 2 quarts of water per day to avoid starvation and dehydration.
- **Light Sources**: Light sources, such as torches and lanterns, burn out over time. For example, a torch typically burns for 1 hour (6 turns), while a lantern with 1 flask of oil burns for 4 hours (24 turns).
- **Spell Duration**: Many spells have durations measured in rounds, turns, hours, or days. The DM should track these durations to determine when spells expire.
- **Potion and Other Magic Item Duration**: Like spells, many potions and other magic items have effects with specific durations that the DM should track.

## Campaign Time

The DM should track the passage of time in the campaign:

- **Calendar**: The DM should establish a calendar for the campaign world, including the number of days in a week, weeks in a month, and months in a year, as well as any special days or seasons.
- **Seasonal Effects**: The DM should consider the effects of seasons on travel, resources, and other activities. For example, winter might make mountain passes impassable and reduce the availability of foraged food.
- **Aging**: Characters age over time, which can affect their abilities and eventually lead to death from old age. The DM should track character ages and apply appropriate effects.
- **Training Time**: Characters typically need time to train between adventures to advance in level. The DM should track this training time and ensure it is accounted for in the campaign timeline.
- **Downtime Activities**: Between adventures, characters may engage in various downtime activities, such as crafting items, researching spells, or managing businesses. The DM should track the time spent on these activities.

## Time Manipulation

Some magical effects can manipulate time:

- **Haste and Slow**: Spells like haste and slow can increase or decrease the rate at which creatures experience time, affecting their movement and actions.
- **Time Stop**: The time stop spell allows the caster to act while time is stopped for everyone else, effectively giving them extra actions.
- **Temporal Stasis**: The temporal stasis spell places a creature in suspended animation, effectively removing them from the flow of time.
- **Aging Effects**: Some magical effects, such as a ghost's aging touch or certain cursed items, can cause unnatural aging, advancing a character's age without the corresponding passage of time.

## Conclusion

Time is a crucial element of the AD&D game, providing structure for activities, movement, and the progression of events in the campaign world. The DM should track time carefully, considering its effects on resources, spells, and character development, while also using it as a tool to create a dynamic and evolving campaign world.
