# Time

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Time in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is a crucial element that structures gameplay, affects character actions, and provides a framework for campaign events. This section provides detailed information on time and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on managing temporal aspects of the game.

## Game Time vs. Real Time

There are several distinct types of time in the AD&D game:

- **Game Time**: The fictional time that passes in the campaign world, which can be compressed or expanded relative to real time.
- **Real Time**: The actual time spent by players and the DM at the gaming table.
- **Metagame Time**: Time spent on out-of-character activities such as rules discussions, planning, or resolving disputes.
- **Narrative Time**: Time compressed through narration, such as "You travel for three days without incident."
- **Action Time**: Time expanded through detailed play, such as combat rounds that represent only seconds of game time but may take minutes of real time to resolve.

## Time Units in the Game

The AD&D game uses several units to measure game time:

- **Segment**: 1/10 of a round, approximately 6 seconds, primarily used for spell casting timing.
- **Round**: Approximately 1 minute, the basic unit of time in combat and other detailed action sequences.
- **Turn**: 10 minutes, the basic unit of time for dungeon exploration, including activities such as searching rooms, picking locks, or examining objects.
- **Hour**: 60 minutes or 6 turns, used for longer activities such as resting, studying spells, or traveling short distances.
- **Day**: 24 hours, used for long-distance travel, recovery, and other extended activities.
- **Week**: 7 days, used for training, research, crafting, and other prolonged activities.
- **Month**: Typically 30 days (though this may vary by campaign calendar), used for seasonal changes, long-term projects, and campaign events.
- **Year**: Typically 12 months (though this may vary by campaign calendar), used for aging, very long-term projects, and major campaign developments.

## Time in Combat

Combat time is structured to manage the complex interactions of multiple participants:

- **Initiative**: Each round begins with initiative determination, which establishes the order of actions within the round.
- **Declaration Phase**: Participants declare their intended actions for the round, with the DM typically requiring player declarations before revealing NPC or monster actions.
- **Action Resolution**: Actions are resolved in order of initiative, with various factors such as weapon speed, spell casting time, and movement rate affecting the specific timing within the round.
- **Simultaneous Actions**: Some actions may occur simultaneously, particularly when initiative rolls are tied or when actions are specifically designed to be concurrent.
- **Action Timing**: Different actions take different amounts of time within a round:
  - Melee attacks typically take the full round.
  - Missile attacks may allow multiple attacks per round depending on the weapon and the character's abilities.
  - Spell casting takes a specific number of segments based on the spell's casting time.
  - Movement occurs at a rate determined by the character's movement rate and encumbrance.

## Time in Dungeon Exploration

Dungeon exploration time is measured primarily in turns:

- **Movement**: Characters typically move at a base rate of 12" per turn in dungeons, with each inch representing 10 feet. This rate is modified by encumbrance, terrain, and cautious movement.
- **Searching**: Thoroughly searching a 10' Ã— 10' area typically takes 1 turn.
- **Listening**: Listening at a door or in a specific location typically takes 1 round.
- **Mapping**: Creating a map while exploring typically slows movement by 1/3.
- **Rest**: Characters typically need to rest for 1 turn after every 5 turns of exploration or after combat.
- **Light Sources**: Light sources have specific durations:
  - Torches typically burn for 6 turns (1 hour).
  - Lanterns typically burn for 24 turns (4 hours) per flask of oil.
  - Light spells typically last 6 turns plus 1 turn per level of the caster.

## Time in Wilderness Travel

Wilderness travel time is measured primarily in days:

- **Movement**: Characters typically move at a base rate of 12" per day in wilderness, with each inch representing 1 mile. This rate is modified by terrain, weather, and encumbrance.
- **Forced March**: Characters can increase their movement rate by up to 50% through forced marching, but this requires Constitution checks to avoid exhaustion.
- **Rest**: Characters typically need one full day of rest after six days of travel.
- **Hunting and Foraging**: Hunting and foraging typically take 4-8 hours per day and reduce the distance that can be traveled.
- **Camping**: Setting up and breaking down camp typically takes 1 hour each.
- **Weather Effects**: Adverse weather can significantly reduce travel rates or even prevent travel entirely.

## Time for Other Activities

Various other activities have specific time requirements:

- **Spell Memorization**: Magic-users and illusionists require 15 minutes of study per spell level to memorize spells, while clerics and druids require 1 hour of prayer to prepare their daily spells.
- **Healing**: Natural healing typically provides 1 hit point per day of complete rest or 1 hit point per 2 days of light activity.
- **Research**: Magical research typically requires 1-4 weeks per spell level or item power level.
- **Training**: Training for level advancement typically requires 1-4 weeks, depending on the class and level.
- **Construction**: Building structures such as castles, temples, or towers typically requires months or years, depending on the size and complexity.
- **Crafting**: Crafting items such as weapons, armor, or tools typically requires days or weeks, depending on the item's complexity.

## Calendar and Timekeeping

Campaigns typically use a calendar to track the passage of time:

- **Standard Calendar**: The standard AD&D calendar consists of 12 months of 30 days each, divided into 3 weeks of 10 days each, for a total of 360 days per year.
- **Alternative Calendars**: DMs may create alternative calendars for their campaigns, with different numbers of months, days per month, or days per week, often reflecting the fictional cultures and cosmology of the campaign world.
- **Seasons**: Regardless of the specific calendar, most campaigns include the four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter), which affect weather, travel conditions, and available resources.
- **Festivals and Holidays**: Calendars typically include festivals and holidays that provide role-playing opportunities and may affect the availability of services or the behavior of NPCs.
- **Astronomical Events**: Calendars may include astronomical events such as solstices, equinoxes, eclipses, or the appearances of comets, which may have magical significance or trigger specific campaign events.

## Time and Magic

Magic interacts with time in various ways:

- **Spell Duration**: Spells have specific durations, ranging from instantaneous to permanent, with most falling somewhere in between (rounds, turns, hours, days, etc.).
- **Time-Affecting Spells**: Some spells directly affect the perception or flow of time, such as haste, slow, or temporal stasis.
- **Time-Limited Magic Items**: Many magic items have time-limited effects or can only be used a certain number of times per day, turn, or other time period.
- **Magical Aging**: Some magical effects cause premature aging, while others can restore youth or extend lifespan.
- **Time Travel**: In some campaigns, powerful magic may allow limited forms of time travel, though this is typically rare and fraught with complications.

## Managing Time in the Campaign

The DM should consider several factors when managing time in the campaign:

- **Time Tracking**: Maintain a campaign calendar to track the passage of time, noting significant events, character activities, and seasonal changes.
- **Time Compression**: Compress uneventful periods through narration rather than playing them out in detail, focusing real-time play on significant or interesting events.
- **Time Expansion**: Expand important or complex sequences, such as combat or crucial social interactions, to allow for detailed play and meaningful decisions.
- **Time Consistency**: Maintain consistency in how time is tracked and how long activities take, establishing precedents that players can rely on for planning.
- **Time Pressure**: Use time pressure, such as deadlines, limited resources, or approaching threats, to create tension and force meaningful choices.
- **Time Consequences**: Ensure that the passage of time has meaningful consequences, such as changing seasons, aging characters, or evolving political situations.

## Aging and Lifespan

Characters age over the course of a campaign:

- **Starting Age**: Characters typically begin play at young adult age, which varies by race and class:
  - Humans: 16-19 (fighters), 20-29 (clerics, thieves), 24-30 (magic-users)
  - Dwarves: 40-50 (fighters), 50-65 (clerics, thieves)
  - Elves: 100-175 (all classes)
  - Halflings: 20-30 (fighters, thieves)
  - Half-Elves: 22-30 (fighters), 30-45 (clerics, thieves), 35-50 (magic-users)
  - Half-Orcs: 13-16 (fighters), 15-22 (clerics, thieves), 20-25 (assassins)

- **Age Categories**: Characters progress through several age categories:
  - Young Adult: Full physical capabilities, slight mental limitations
  - Mature: Full physical and mental capabilities
  - Middle-Aged: Slight physical decline, mental improvement
  - Old: Significant physical decline, further mental improvement
  - Venerable: Severe physical decline, maximum mental capabilities

- **Age Effects**: Aging affects ability scores:
  - Middle Age: -1 Strength, -1 Constitution, -1 Dexterity, +1 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom
  - Old Age: -2 Strength, -2 Constitution, -2 Dexterity, +1 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom
  - Venerable: -1 Strength, -1 Constitution, -1 Dexterity, +1 Intelligence, +1 Wisdom

- **Maximum Lifespan**: Maximum lifespan varies by race:
  - Humans: 90-120 years
  - Dwarves: 250-350 years
  - Elves: 600-900 years
  - Halflings: 150-200 years
  - Half-Elves: 160-220 years
  - Half-Orcs: 70-90 years

## Conclusion

Time is a fundamental aspect of the AD&D game, providing structure for gameplay, affecting character actions and abilities, and creating a framework for campaign events. The DM should use time thoughtfully to enhance the game experience, compressing uneventful periods while expanding important sequences, and ensuring that the passage of time has meaningful consequences in the campaign world. By understanding the different time units and their applications in various aspects of the game, the DM can create a more immersive and coherent campaign that balances detail with pacing.
