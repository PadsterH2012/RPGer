# Player Character Non-Professional Skills

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In addition to the skills and abilities associated with their class, player characters in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game may possess non-professional skills. These skills represent knowledge and abilities that the character has acquired outside of their professional training, and they can add depth and versatility to the character.

## Types of Non-Professional Skills

Non-professional skills can include a wide range of abilities, from practical crafts to academic knowledge. The following are examples of non-professional skills that a character might possess:

- **Crafts**: Carpentry, blacksmithing, leatherworking, weaving, pottery, and other practical crafts.
- **Fine Arts**: Painting, sculpture, music, dance, poetry, and other artistic pursuits.
- **Languages**: Knowledge of languages beyond those granted by the character's race and class.
- **Academic Knowledge**: History, geography, heraldry, astronomy, and other fields of study.
- **Practical Skills**: Cooking, brewing, animal handling, navigation, and other useful abilities.

## Acquiring Non-Professional Skills

Characters can acquire non-professional skills in several ways:

- **Background**: The character may have learned skills during their upbringing or early life, before becoming an adventurer.
- **Training**: The character may have received formal training in a skill, either as part of their education or through an apprenticeship.
- **Self-Study**: The character may have taught themselves a skill through practice and observation.
- **Experience**: The character may have developed a skill through experience and practical application.

## Using Non-Professional Skills

Non-professional skills can be used in a variety of ways during the game:

- **Problem-Solving**: Skills can be used to solve problems or overcome obstacles. For example, a character with carpentry skills might be able to repair a damaged bridge, or a character with knowledge of heraldry might be able to identify a noble family's coat of arms.
- **Role-Playing**: Skills can be used to enhance role-playing and character development. For example, a character with musical skills might perform at a tavern, or a character with knowledge of history might share stories about ancient civilizations.
- **Income**: Skills can be used to earn income during downtime. For example, a character with blacksmithing skills might forge weapons and armor to sell, or a character with artistic skills might create and sell works of art.

## Determining Success with Non-Professional Skills

When a character attempts to use a non-professional skill, the DM must determine whether the attempt is successful. This can be done in several ways:

- **Automatic Success**: If the task is simple and the character has the appropriate skill, the DM may decide that the attempt is automatically successful.
- **Ability Check**: The DM may require the character to make an ability check, using the ability score most relevant to the skill. For example, a character using carpentry skills might make a Dexterity check, or a character using knowledge of history might make an Intelligence check.
- **Percentage Chance**: The DM may assign a percentage chance of success, based on the difficulty of the task and the character's proficiency with the skill.

## Conclusion

Non-professional skills can add depth and versatility to player characters, allowing them to contribute to the game in ways beyond their class abilities. The DM should encourage players to develop non-professional skills for their characters, and should provide opportunities for characters to use these skills during the game.
