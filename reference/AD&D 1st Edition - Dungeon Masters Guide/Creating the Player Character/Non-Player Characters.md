# Non-Player Characters

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are an essential element of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. They are the characters controlled by the Dungeon Master (DM), as opposed to the Player Characters (PCs) who are controlled by the players. NPCs include a wide range of characters, from the humble shopkeeper to the powerful wizard, from the loyal henchman to the devious villain.

## Types of Non-Player Characters

There are several types of NPCs in the AD&D game:

- **Henchmen**: These are NPCs who are loyal followers of a PC. They are typically of lower level than the PC they serve, and they receive a share of treasure and experience points. Henchmen are created using the same rules as PCs, but they are controlled by the DM.
- **Hirelings**: These are NPCs who are employed by a PC for a specific task or for a specific period of time. They are typically paid a wage, and they do not receive a share of treasure or experience points. Hirelings include porters, guides, mercenaries, and other employees.
- **Retainers**: These are NPCs who are permanently employed by a PC, typically at the PC's stronghold or base of operations. They include stewards, guards, craftsmen, and other staff.
- **Allies**: These are NPCs who are friendly to the PCs and who may assist them in their adventures. They include friendly rulers, helpful sages, and other characters who have a positive relationship with the PCs.
- **Enemies**: These are NPCs who are hostile to the PCs and who may oppose them in their adventures. They include villains, monsters, and other characters who have a negative relationship with the PCs.
- **Neutral Characters**: These are NPCs who are neither friendly nor hostile to the PCs. They include shopkeepers, innkeepers, and other characters who interact with the PCs but who do not have a strong relationship with them.

## Creating Non-Player Characters

The creation of NPCs is similar to the creation of PCs, but there are some differences:

- **Ability Scores**: NPCs typically have ability scores generated using Method I (roll 3d6 in order), unless they are important characters in the campaign.
- **Race and Class**: NPCs can be of any race and class allowed in the campaign, but the DM should consider the demographics of the campaign world when determining the race and class of NPCs.
- **Level**: NPCs can be of any level, but the DM should consider the level of the PCs when determining the level of NPCs. Henchmen are typically of lower level than the PCs they serve.
- **Alignment**: NPCs can be of any alignment, but the DM should consider the alignment of the PCs when determining the alignment of NPCs. Henchmen typically have an alignment compatible with the PC they serve.
- **Personality**: NPCs should have distinct personalities, which can be developed through role-playing. The DM should consider the NPC's background, goals, fears, and other factors when developing the NPC's personality.

## Role-Playing Non-Player Characters

The DM is responsible for role-playing NPCs during the game. This involves speaking as the NPC, making decisions for the NPC, and determining the NPC's actions. The DM should strive to make each NPC a distinct character with a unique personality.

When role-playing an NPC, the DM should consider:

- **The NPC's Personality**: How does the NPC typically behave? Is the NPC friendly, hostile, cautious, brave, cowardly, honest, dishonest, or some combination of these traits?
- **The NPC's Goals**: What does the NPC want? How does the NPC plan to achieve these goals?
- **The NPC's Relationship with the PCs**: How does the NPC feel about the PCs? Does the NPC trust them, fear them, respect them, or some combination of these feelings?
- **The NPC's Knowledge**: What does the NPC know? What information can the NPC provide to the PCs?

## Conclusion

Non-Player Characters are an essential element of the AD&D game. They provide the PCs with allies, enemies, sources of information, and other characters with whom to interact. The DM is responsible for creating and role-playing NPCs, and should strive to make each NPC a distinct character with a unique personality.
