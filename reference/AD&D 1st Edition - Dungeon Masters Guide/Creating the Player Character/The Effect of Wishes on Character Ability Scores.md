# The Effect of Wishes on Character Ability Scores

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

The wish spell is one of the most powerful spells in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. It allows the caster to alter reality in significant ways, including the enhancement of character ability scores. However, the use of wishes to enhance ability scores is subject to certain limitations and considerations.

## Wishes and Ability Score Enhancement

A wish can be used to enhance a character's ability scores, but the effect is limited and subject to the DM's interpretation. The following guidelines apply:

- **Maximum Enhancement**: A wish can enhance an ability score by a maximum of 1 point.
- **Maximum Score**: An ability score cannot be enhanced beyond the racial maximum for the character's race.
- **Multiple Wishes**: Multiple wishes can be used to enhance the same ability score, but each successive wish has a diminishing effect. The first wish enhances the ability score by 1 point, the second wish enhances it by 1/2 point, the third wish enhances it by 1/4 point, and so on.
- **Exceptional Strength**: A wish can be used to enhance a fighter's exceptional Strength (percentile Strength), but the enhancement is limited to 10 percentile points per wish.

## The DM's Role in Wish Interpretation

The DM plays a crucial role in the interpretation of wishes. The DM should consider the following factors when interpreting a wish for ability score enhancement:

- **The Wording of the Wish**: The exact wording of the wish is important. The DM should interpret the wish based on the literal meaning of the words used, not the intent of the character making the wish.
- **The Source of the Wish**: The source of the wish can affect its interpretation. A wish from a powerful being may be interpreted more favorably than a wish from a less powerful source.
- **The Alignment of the Character**: The alignment of the character making the wish can affect its interpretation. A wish made by a good-aligned character may be interpreted more favorably than a wish made by an evil-aligned character.
- **The Context of the Wish**: The context in which the wish is made can affect its interpretation. A wish made in a desperate situation may be interpreted more favorably than a wish made in a casual situation.

## Unintended Consequences

Wishes can have unintended consequences, particularly if they are worded poorly or if they are used for selfish or evil purposes. The DM should consider the possibility of unintended consequences when interpreting a wish for ability score enhancement. For example:

- A wish for "great strength" might result in the character becoming physically strong but mentally weak, with a corresponding decrease in Intelligence or Wisdom.
- A wish for "enhanced abilities" might result in the enhancement of all ability scores, but with a corresponding decrease in the character's lifespan.
- A wish for "the strength of a giant" might result in the character literally becoming a giant, with all the advantages and disadvantages that entails.

## Conclusion

The use of wishes to enhance ability scores is a powerful option, but it is subject to limitations and considerations. The DM plays a crucial role in the interpretation of wishes, and should strive to balance the power of wishes with the need for game balance and narrative coherence.
