# Generation of Ability Scores

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

The generation of ability scores is the first step in creating a player character for the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. The ability scores represent the character's natural aptitudes and capabilities, and they have a significant impact on the character's performance in the game.

## The Six Ability Scores

There are six ability scores in the AD&D game:

- **Strength (STR)**: This ability measures the character's physical power, and it affects the character's ability to hit in combat, to cause damage, to force doors open, and to perform other feats of physical strength.
- **Intelligence (INT)**: This ability measures the character's mental acuity, and it affects the character's ability to learn and use knowledge, to understand languages, and to cast certain types of spells.
- **Wisdom (WIS)**: This ability measures the character's common sense and willpower, and it affects the character's ability to resist certain types of spells and other mental influences, and to cast certain types of spells.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: This ability measures the character's agility and hand-eye coordination, and it affects the character's ability to hit with missile weapons, to avoid being hit, and to perform tasks requiring manual dexterity.
- **Constitution (CON)**: This ability measures the character's physical stamina and health, and it affects the character's hit points, ability to survive resurrection, and resistance to certain types of spells and other physical effects.
- **Charisma (CHA)**: This ability measures the character's force of personality and leadership ability, and it affects the character's ability to influence others, to attract and retain followers, and to cast certain types of spells.

## Methods of Generating Ability Scores

There are several methods for generating ability scores, and the DM should decide which method will be used in the campaign. The following methods are commonly used:

### Method I: Roll 3d6 in Order

The player rolls three six-sided dice (3d6) for each ability score, in the order listed above (STR, INT, WIS, DEX, CON, CHA). The total of the three dice is the ability score. This method produces characters with a wide range of abilities, and it can result in characters with very low scores in some abilities.

### Method II: Roll 3d6 Twelve Times and Select Six Scores

The player rolls 3d6 twelve times, recording each roll. The player then selects six of these rolls to be the character's ability scores, assigning them to the abilities as desired. This method allows the player some control over the character's abilities, but it still produces characters with a wide range of abilities.

### Method III: Roll 3d6 Six Times and Arrange as Desired

The player rolls 3d6 six times, recording each roll. The player then assigns these six rolls to the abilities as desired. This method gives the player more control over the character's abilities, allowing the player to place higher rolls in abilities that are more important for the character's class.

### Method IV: Roll 4d6, Drop Lowest Die, Arrange as Desired

The player rolls four six-sided dice (4d6) for each ability score, discards the lowest die, and adds the remaining three dice. The player then assigns these six totals to the abilities as desired. This method tends to produce characters with higher ability scores, as the average result of 4d6 drop lowest is higher than the average result of 3d6.

## Minimum and Maximum Ability Scores

The minimum ability score is 3, and the maximum is 18 for most races. Some races have adjustments to certain ability scores, which can result in scores below 3 or above 18. For example, a Dwarf receives a +1 bonus to Constitution and a -1 penalty to Charisma.

## Exceptional Strength

Fighters (including Rangers and Paladins) with a Strength score of 18 may roll percentile dice to determine their exceptional Strength, which can range from 01 to 00 (treated as 100). This exceptional Strength provides additional bonuses to hit, damage, and other Strength-related abilities.

## Conclusion

The generation of ability scores is a crucial step in character creation, as the ability scores have a significant impact on the character's performance in the game. The DM should decide which method of generating ability scores will be used in the campaign, and should ensure that the method is applied consistently for all players.
