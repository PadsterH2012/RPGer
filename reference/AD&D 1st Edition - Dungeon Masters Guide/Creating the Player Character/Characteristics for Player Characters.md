# Characteristics for Player Characters

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In addition to the six ability scores (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma), player characters in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game have several other characteristics that define them. These characteristics include physical traits, background details, and other aspects of the character that contribute to the character's identity and role in the game.

## Physical Characteristics

Physical characteristics include the character's appearance, age, height, weight, and other physical traits. These characteristics can be determined by the player, with the DM's approval, or they can be determined randomly using tables provided in the Players Handbook.

### Age

The character's age can have an impact on the character's abilities and role in the game. The following guidelines apply:

- **Starting Age**: The character's starting age is determined based on the character's race and class. Humans typically start at a younger age than demi-humans (elves, dwarves, etc.), and characters of certain classes (such as magic-users) typically start at an older age than characters of other classes (such as fighters).
- **Age Effects**: As characters age, they may experience changes in their ability scores. Typically, physical abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) decrease with age, while mental abilities (Intelligence, Wisdom) increase with age.
- **Maximum Age**: Each race has a maximum age, beyond which the character cannot survive without magical intervention.

### Height and Weight

The character's height and weight can be determined by the player, with the DM's approval, or they can be determined randomly using tables provided in the Players Handbook. The character's race and gender can affect the character's height and weight.

### Other Physical Traits

Other physical traits include the character's hair color, eye color, skin tone, and other aspects of the character's appearance. These traits can be determined by the player, with the DM's approval, and they can contribute to the character's identity and role in the game.

## Background Characteristics

Background characteristics include the character's family, upbringing, education, and other aspects of the character's history. These characteristics can be determined by the player, with the DM's approval, and they can contribute to the character's identity and role in the game.

### Family

The character's family can include parents, siblings, and other relatives. The character's relationship with these family members can be an important aspect of the character's background and can provide hooks for adventures and role-playing opportunities.

### Upbringing

The character's upbringing can include the character's childhood experiences, education, and other formative influences. The character's upbringing can affect the character's skills, knowledge, and attitudes, and it can provide hooks for adventures and role-playing opportunities.

### Education

The character's education can include formal schooling, apprenticeship, self-study, and other forms of learning. The character's education can affect the character's skills, knowledge, and attitudes, and it can provide hooks for adventures and role-playing opportunities.

## Other Characteristics

Other characteristics include the character's personality, goals, fears, and other aspects of the character's psychology. These characteristics can be determined by the player, with the DM's approval, and they can contribute to the character's identity and role in the game.

### Personality

The character's personality can include the character's temperament, attitudes, values, and other aspects of the character's psychology. The character's personality can affect the character's interactions with other characters and can provide hooks for adventures and role-playing opportunities.

### Goals

The character's goals can include short-term objectives, long-term ambitions, and other aspirations. The character's goals can drive the character's actions and can provide hooks for adventures and role-playing opportunities.

### Fears

The character's fears can include phobias, anxieties, and other sources of dread. The character's fears can affect the character's actions and can provide hooks for adventures and role-playing opportunities.

## Conclusion

Characteristics for player characters go beyond the six ability scores to include physical traits, background details, and other aspects of the character that contribute to the character's identity and role in the game. These characteristics can be determined by the player, with the DM's approval, and they can provide hooks for adventures and role-playing opportunities.
