# Starting Level of Experience for Player Characters

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

The starting level of experience for player characters in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is an important consideration for the Dungeon Master (DM). The level at which characters begin the game can have a significant impact on the nature and difficulty of the adventures they undertake.

## Standard Starting Level

The standard starting level for player characters in the AD&D game is 1st level. At this level, characters are relatively inexperienced and vulnerable, but they have the potential to grow and develop through their adventures. Starting at 1st level allows players to experience the full progression of their characters, from novice adventurers to powerful heroes.

## Considerations for Higher Starting Levels

There may be circumstances in which the DM decides to allow characters to start at a higher level. The following considerations should be taken into account when making this decision:

- **Campaign Setting**: The nature of the campaign setting may suggest a higher starting level. For example, a campaign set in a high-magic world with powerful threats may require characters of higher level to be viable.
- **Adventure Difficulty**: The difficulty of the planned adventures may suggest a higher starting level. If the DM plans to challenge the characters with powerful monsters or complex situations, higher-level characters may be more appropriate.
- **Player Experience**: The experience level of the players may suggest a higher starting level. Experienced players may prefer to start with more capable characters, while new players may benefit from the simpler mechanics of low-level play.
- **Campaign Duration**: The expected duration of the campaign may suggest a higher starting level. If the campaign is expected to be short, starting at a higher level allows players to experience more of the game's content.

## Guidelines for Higher Starting Levels

If the DM decides to allow characters to start at a higher level, the following guidelines should be followed:

- **Experience Points**: Characters should start with the minimum experience points required for their level.
- **Hit Points**: Characters should roll for hit points as if they had progressed through each level, rather than receiving maximum hit points.
- **Equipment**: Characters should receive equipment appropriate to their level, but not excessive. The DM may provide a standard equipment package or allow players to purchase equipment with a set amount of gold pieces.
- **Magical Items**: Characters may receive a limited number of magical items, appropriate to their level. The DM should carefully consider the power and rarity of these items to maintain game balance.
- **Background**: Players should develop a background for their characters that explains how they reached their starting level. This background can provide hooks for adventures and role-playing opportunities.

## Balancing Higher-Level Characters

When characters start at a higher level, the DM must ensure that they are balanced relative to each other and to the challenges they will face. The following strategies can help to maintain balance:

- **Consistent Application of Rules**: The DM should apply the rules for character creation consistently for all players.
- **Review of Character Sheets**: The DM should review all character sheets to ensure that they are accurate and balanced.
- **Adjustment of Challenges**: The DM should adjust the difficulty of challenges to match the capabilities of the characters.
- **Limitation of Magical Items**: The DM should carefully control the number and power of magical items available to the characters.

## Conclusion

The starting level of experience for player characters is an important consideration for the DM. While the standard starting level is 1st level, there may be circumstances in which a higher starting level is appropriate. When allowing characters to start at a higher level, the DM should carefully consider the implications for game balance and should take steps to ensure that the characters are balanced relative to each other and to the challenges they will face.
