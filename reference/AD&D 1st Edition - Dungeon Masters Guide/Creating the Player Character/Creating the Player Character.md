*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

The creation of player characters is a fundamental aspect of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. The process involves several steps, from the generation of ability scores to the selection of equipment and spells. This section provides guidance for the Dungeon Master on overseeing the character creation process.

## Overview of Character Creation

The creation of a player character involves the following steps:

1. **Generation of Ability Scores**: The player rolls dice to determine the character's six ability scores: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.
2. **Selection of Race**: The player selects a race for the character from the available options: Human, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-Elf, Halfling, or Half-Orc.
3. **Selection of Class**: The player selects a class for the character from the available options, based on the character's ability scores and race.
4. **Determination of Alignment**: The player selects an alignment for the character from the available options: Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, or Chaotic Evil.
5. **Calculation of Hit Points**: The player rolls dice to determine the character's hit points, based on the character's class and Constitution score.
6. **Selection of Proficiencies**: The player selects weapon and non-weapon proficiencies for the character, based on the character's class and other factors.
7. **Selection of Equipment**: The player selects equipment for the character, based on the character's class, proficiencies, and available funds.
8. **Selection of Spells**: If the character is a spellcaster, the player selects spells for the character, based on the character's class and level.
9. **Determination of Additional Details**: The player determines additional details for the character, such as name, age, height, weight, and background.

## The Dungeon Master's Role in Character Creation

The Dungeon Master (DM) plays a crucial role in the character creation process. The DM is responsible for:

- **Explaining the Rules**: The DM should explain the rules for character creation to the players, particularly to new players who may not be familiar with the process.
- **Overseeing the Process**: The DM should oversee the character creation process to ensure that it is conducted fairly and according to the rules.
- **Approving Characters**: The DM has the final say on whether a character is acceptable for the campaign. The DM may reject a character that is unbalanced, inappropriate for the campaign, or otherwise problematic.
- **Providing Guidance**: The DM should provide guidance to the players during the character creation process, helping them to create characters that will be enjoyable to play and that will fit well into the campaign.

## Balancing Characters

One of the challenges in character creation is ensuring that all characters are balanced relative to each other. The DM should strive to ensure that no character is significantly more powerful or less powerful than the others. This can be achieved through:

- **Consistent Application of Rules**: The DM should apply the rules for character creation consistently for all players.
- **Adjustments for Exceptional Ability Scores**: The DM may need to make adjustments for characters with exceptionally high or low ability scores.
- **Consideration of Party Composition**: The DM should consider the composition of the party as a whole, ensuring that the party has a good mix of classes and abilities.

## Conclusion

The creation of player characters is a fundamental aspect of the AD&D game. The DM plays a crucial role in this process, explaining the rules, overseeing the process, approving characters, and providing guidance. By ensuring that the character creation process is conducted fairly and according to the rules, the DM can help to create a balanced and enjoyable game for all players.
