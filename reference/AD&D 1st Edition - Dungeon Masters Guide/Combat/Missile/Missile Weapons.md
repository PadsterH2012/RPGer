# Missile Weapons

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Missile weapons in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are weapons designed for ranged combat, used to strike opponents at a distance. This section provides detailed information on missile weapons and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in combat.

## Types of Missile Weapons

There are several categories of missile weapons in the AD&D game:

- **Bows**: Weapons that use the tension of a string to propel arrows, including short bows, long bows, and composite bows.
- **Crossbows**: Mechanical weapons that use a horizontal bow mounted on a stock to propel bolts, including light crossbows, heavy crossbows, and hand crossbows.
- **Slings**: Simple weapons that use centrifugal force to propel stones or bullets, including slings and staff slings.
- **Thrown Weapons**: Weapons designed to be thrown by hand, including daggers, axes, spears, hammers, and darts.
- **Specialized Missile Weapons**: Various other missile weapons with specific designs and uses, such as blowguns, nets, and bolas.

## Missile Weapon Characteristics

Each missile weapon has several characteristics that define its performance in combat:

- **Damage**: The amount of damage the weapon inflicts on a successful hit, typically expressed as a die roll (e.g., 1d6 for a short bow).
- **Range**: The effective distance at which the weapon can be used, typically expressed as three values: short, medium, and long range. Attacks at medium range suffer a -2 penalty, while attacks at long range suffer a -5 penalty.
- **Rate of Fire**: How many times the weapon can be fired per round, reflecting its loading and firing speed.
- **Weight**: The weight of the weapon, affecting encumbrance and who can use it effectively.
- **Ammunition**: The type of ammunition used by the weapon, such as arrows for bows, bolts for crossbows, or stones for slings.
- **Strength Requirement**: Some missile weapons, particularly bows, may have minimum Strength requirements to use effectively.

## Missile Combat Procedure

Missile combat follows a specific procedure:

1. **Determine Range**: The DM determines the distance between the attacker and the target, categorizing it as short, medium, or long range based on the weapon's range characteristics.
2. **Apply Range Modifiers**: The attacker applies range modifiers to their attack roll: no modifier for short range, -2 for medium range, and -5 for long range.
3. **Apply Other Modifiers**: The attacker applies other modifiers to their attack roll, such as Dexterity bonuses, magical bonuses, cover penalties, or movement penalties.
4. **Make Attack Roll**: The attacker rolls a d20, adds all applicable modifiers, and compares the result to the target's Armor Class. If the result equals or exceeds the target's AC, the attack hits.
5. **Roll Damage**: If the attack hits, the attacker rolls for damage based on the weapon used, adding any applicable modifiers such as magical bonuses.

## Factors Affecting Missile Combat

Several factors can affect missile combat:

- **Dexterity**: A character's Dexterity score affects their ability to hit with missile weapons. High Dexterity provides bonuses to hit, while low Dexterity imposes penalties.
- **Cover**: Targets behind cover are harder to hit with missile weapons. The amount of cover (partial, half, three-quarters, or full) determines the penalty to the attack roll.
- **Concealment**: Targets that are concealed but not physically protected (such as in fog, smoke, or darkness) are also harder to hit, with penalties similar to those for cover.
- **Movement**: Moving targets are harder to hit with missile weapons. Targets moving at walking speed impose a -2 penalty, while those moving at running speed impose a -4 penalty.
- **Firing While Moving**: Characters who fire missile weapons while moving suffer penalties to their attack rolls, typically -4 for walking and impossible for running.
- **Elevation**: Attackers at higher elevation than their targets gain advantages in range and potentially in attack rolls, while those at lower elevation suffer disadvantages.

## Special Missile Combat Situations

Various special situations can arise in missile combat:

- **Firing into Melee**: Characters firing missile weapons into a melee combat risk hitting allies. If the attack roll misses the intended target, the DM may determine that another combatant in the melee is hit instead.
- **Called Shots**: Characters may attempt to hit specific parts of a target (such as the head, arms, or legs) or to perform specific feats (such as shooting an item out of someone's hand). These attempts typically impose significant penalties to the attack roll.
- **Volley Fire**: Multiple archers firing at a large group of targets may use volley fire, where they aim at an area rather than specific individuals. This can be effective against massed opponents but less accurate against specific targets.
- **Indirect Fire**: Some missile weapons, particularly bows with arcing shots, can be fired over obstacles to hit targets that are not in direct line of sight. This typically imposes penalties to the attack roll.
- **Ammunition Breakage**: Ammunition can break or become unusable after being fired. Typically, there is a chance (such as 50%) that arrows or bolts can be recovered after a battle, with half of those recovered being reusable.

## Magical Missile Weapons and Ammunition

Magical missile weapons and ammunition provide various benefits:

- **Attack and Damage Bonuses**: Magical missile weapons and ammunition typically provide bonuses to attack rolls and damage rolls, expressed as a plus (e.g., a long bow +1 provides a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls).
- **Special Properties**: Some magical missile weapons or ammunition have special properties, such as the ability to return to the wielder after being thrown, to hit incorporeal creatures, or to cause additional effects on a hit.
- **Specific Target Bonuses**: Some magical missile weapons or ammunition are particularly effective against specific types of creatures, providing additional bonuses to hit or damage against those creatures.
- **Ammunition Consumption**: Magical ammunition is typically consumed when used, unlike magical melee weapons. However, some magical ammunition may have a chance to be recovered and reused.

## Class Restrictions on Missile Weapons

Different character classes have different restrictions on the types of missile weapons they can use:

- **Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers**: Can use any missile weapon.
- **Clerics**: Are restricted to slings and staff slings (no bows, crossbows, or thrown edged weapons).
- **Druids**: Are restricted to certain missile weapons (club, dagger, dart, hammer, scimitar, sling, spear).
- **Magic-Users and Illusionists**: Are restricted to daggers and darts.
- **Thieves**: Can use certain missile weapons (club, dagger, dart, sling).
- **Assassins**: Can use any missile weapon.
- **Monks**: Can use certain missile weapons (club, dagger, hand axe, javelin, spear).
- **Bards**: Can use any missile weapon.

## Conclusion

Missile weapons add a crucial dimension to combat in the AD&D game, allowing characters to engage opponents at a distance and providing tactical options beyond melee combat. The DM should use these guidelines to handle missile weapons in a way that is realistic and consistent, while also considering the specific needs and themes of the campaign. By understanding the characteristics and rules for different types of missile weapons, the DM can create more dynamic and engaging combat encounters that reward player skill and tactical thinking.
