# Weapon Speed Factors

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Overview

Weapon speed factors represent the relative quickness with which different weapons can be wielded in combat. These factors influence initiative determination and can be crucial in resolving simultaneous attacks. While optional, the weapon speed factor system adds tactical depth to combat by making weapon choice more meaningful beyond simple damage considerations.

## Basic Weapon Speed System

### Speed Factor Scale

Weapon speed factors are rated on a numerical scale:

- **1**: Fastest weapons (dagger, dart)
- **2-4**: Quick weapons (short sword, hand axe)
- **5-7**: Medium speed weapons (long sword, mace)
- **8-10**: Slow weapons (two-handed sword, pole arm)
- **11+**: Very slow weapons (heavy crossbow, pike)

Lower numbers indicate faster weapons that can be wielded more quickly.

### Standard Weapon Speed Factors

| Weapon | Speed Factor |
|--------|--------------|
| Dagger | 2 |
| Dart | 2 |
| Hand Axe | 4 |
| Javelin | 4 |
| Short Sword | 3 |
| Club | 4 |
| Mace | 6 |
| Flail | 7 |
| Long Sword | 5 |
| Battle Axe | 7 |
| Morning Star | 7 |
| Spear | 6 |
| Trident | 7 |
| Halberd | 9 |
| Two-Handed Sword | 10 |
| Pike | 13 |
| Short Bow | 7 |
| Long Bow | 8 |
| Light Crossbow | 7 |
| Heavy Crossbow | 10 |
| Sling | 6 |

## Using Weapon Speed in Combat

### Basic Initiative System

1. Each side rolls 1d6 for initiative
2. The higher roll wins initiative
3. In case of a tie, actions occur simultaneously
4. Weapon speed factors are used to break ties or determine order within segments

### Detailed Initiative System

1. Each side rolls 1d6 for initiative
2. Add weapon speed factor to the roll
3. The lower modified total acts first
4. If still tied, actions occur simultaneously

### Segmented Round System

In the optional segmented round system (where each round is divided into 10 segments):

1. Each combatant rolls 1d10 for base segment
2. Add weapon speed factor to determine actual segment of action
3. Actions occur in ascending segment order
4. Multiple actions in the same segment occur simultaneously

### Weapon Speed and Spell Casting

When comparing weapon attacks to spell casting:

1. Spell casting time is equivalent to weapon speed factor
2. A spell with casting time of 3 segments is comparable to a weapon with speed factor 3
3. Faster weapons may interrupt spell casting if they strike before the spell is completed

## Modifiers to Weapon Speed

Several factors can modify the base weapon speed factor:

### Strength Modifiers

| Strength | Modifier to Weapon Speed |
|----------|--------------------------|
| 3-5 | +2 (slower) |
| 6-8 | +1 (slower) |
| 9-12 | 0 (no change) |
| 13-15 | -1 (faster) |
| 16-17 | -2 (faster) |
| 18 | -3 (faster) |
| 18/01-50 | -3 (faster) |
| 18/51-75 | -4 (faster) |
| 18/76-90 | -4 (faster) |
| 18/91-99 | -5 (faster) |
| 18/00 | -6 (faster) |

### Dexterity Modifiers

| Dexterity | Modifier to Weapon Speed |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| 3-5 | +2 (slower) |
| 6-8 | +1 (slower) |
| 9-12 | 0 (no change) |
| 13-15 | -1 (faster) |
| 16-17 | -2 (faster) |
| 18 | -3 (faster) |

### Weapon Quality Modifiers

| Weapon Quality | Modifier to Weapon Speed |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Poor | +1 (slower) |
| Average | 0 (no change) |
| Fine | -1 (faster) |
| Exceptional | -2 (faster) |

### Magical Weapon Modifiers

| Magical Bonus | Modifier to Weapon Speed |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| +1 | -1 (faster) |
| +2 | -1 (faster) |
| +3 | -2 (faster) |
| +4 | -2 (faster) |
| +5 | -3 (faster) |

### Situational Modifiers

| Situation | Modifier to Weapon Speed |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Confined space | +1 to +3 (slower) |
| Underwater | +4 (slower) |
| Mounted combat | +1 (slower) |
| Fighting in mud | +2 (slower) |
| Entangled | +2 to +4 (slower) |
| Surprised | +2 (slower) |
| Fatigued | +1 (slower) |
| Wounded (below 50% hp) | +1 (slower) |

## Weapon Length and Reach

Weapon length interacts with weapon speed to determine which combatant strikes first in certain situations.

### Weapon Length Categories

| Category | Length | Example Weapons |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| Very Short | 1-2' | Dagger, hand axe |
| Short | 2-3' | Short sword, club |
| Medium | 3-4.5' | Long sword, mace, battle axe |
| Long | 4.5-6' | Two-handed sword, spear |
| Very Long | 6-8' | Pike, halberd, lance |
| Extreme | 8'+ | Pike, certain pole arms |

### First Strike Determination

When combatants first engage:

1. The combatant with the longer weapon strikes first
2. After the first exchange, weapon speed factors determine order
3. If the longer weapon is significantly slower, the DM may rule that the faster weapon strikes first

### Closing Distance

When a combatant with a shorter weapon wishes to negate the reach advantage:

1. Must survive the first attack from the longer weapon
2. Must win initiative on the next round
3. Makes a successful closing maneuver (often requiring a Dexterity check)
4. Once inside the longer weapon's effective range, the shorter weapon has advantage

## Weapon Speed and Special Combat Situations

### Multiple Attacks

Characters with multiple attacks per round (high-level fighters, rangers, etc.) must consider weapon speed:

1. First attack occurs according to normal weapon speed rules
2. Subsequent attacks occur later in the round
3. For simplicity, space additional attacks evenly throughout the round

### Two-Weapon Fighting

When fighting with two weapons:

1. Primary weapon uses its normal speed factor
2. Secondary weapon attacks 2 segments after the primary weapon
3. If using weapons of significantly different speeds, the faster weapon may attack first

### Weapon Speed and Armor

Heavier armor can slow weapon speed:

| Armor Type | Modifier to Weapon Speed |
|------------|--------------------------|
| No armor | 0 (no change) |
| Leather | 0 (no change) |
| Studded leather | +1 (slower) |
| Ring mail | +1 (slower) |
| Scale mail | +2 (slower) |
| Chain mail | +2 (slower) |
| Splint mail | +3 (slower) |
| Banded mail | +3 (slower) |
| Plate mail | +4 (slower) |

### Weapon Speed and Shield Use

Using a shield can affect weapon speed:

| Shield Type | Modifier to Weapon Speed |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Buckler | 0 (no change) |
| Small shield | +1 (slower) |
| Medium shield | +1 (slower) |
| Large shield | +2 (slower) |
| Tower shield | +3 (slower) |

## Tactical Considerations

### Choosing Weapons Based on Speed

Weapon speed becomes tactically important in several situations:

- **Against Spellcasters**: Faster weapons may interrupt spells
- **When Outnumbered**: Faster weapons allow more attacks in less time
- **In Ambush Situations**: Faster weapons capitalize on surprise
- **When Retreating**: Faster weapons allow attack and withdrawal
- **Against Slow, Powerful Foes**: Faster weapons may allow multiple attacks before the foe can respond

### Weapon Speed vs. Damage

Players must balance the trade-off between weapon speed and damage:

- Faster weapons typically deal less damage
- Slower weapons typically deal more damage
- In short combats, faster weapons may be preferable
- In prolonged combats, higher damage may be more important

### Weapon Speed and Character Class

Different classes may prioritize weapon speed differently:

- **Fighters**: May prefer damage over speed
- **Thieves**: Often prioritize speed for backstab opportunities
- **Magic-Users**: Need fast weapons for emergency defense
- **Clerics**: Balance between speed and damage with limited weapon choices

## Advanced Weapon Speed Rules (Optional)

### Weapon Speed and Critical Hits

In campaigns using critical hit rules:

1. Faster weapons (speed factor 1-3) may critical on natural 19-20
2. Medium weapons (speed factor 4-7) critical on natural 20
3. Slow weapons (speed factor 8+) may require confirmation roll after natural 20

### Weapon Speed and Parrying

When using the optional parrying rules:

1. Faster weapons gain +1 to parrying attempts
2. Weapons at least 3 factors faster than the opponent's gain +2
3. Slower weapons suffer -1 to parrying attempts
4. Weapons at least 3 factors slower than the opponent's suffer -2

### Weapon Speed and Fatigue

In campaigns using fatigue rules:

1. Slower weapons (speed factor 8+) cause fatigue more quickly
2. Each round using such weapons counts as 1.5 rounds for fatigue purposes
3. Very slow weapons (speed factor 11+) count as 2 rounds

### Weapon Speed and Called Shots

When attempting called shots (targeting specific body parts):

1. Weapon speed factor is increased by 2
2. This represents the additional time needed for precision
3. Fast weapons become particularly valuable for called shots
