*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Overview

The effectiveness of weapons in AD&D varies based on their design, construction, and the type of opponent they are used against. This document details the various weapon categories, their damage potential, and special considerations for their use in combat.

## Weapon Categories

Weapons in AD&D can be classified in several ways:

### By Construction

- **Metallic**: Swords, maces, metal-headed axes, etc.

- **Bludgeoning (B)**: Weapons that crush with impact (maces, hammers, flails)
- **Combined (P/S)**: Weapons that can both pierce and slash (certain swords)

### By Range

- **Melee**: Used in hand-to-hand combat (swords, maces, axes)
- **Thrown**: Melee weapons that can be thrown (daggers, spears, axes)
