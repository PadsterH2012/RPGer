# Weapon Proficiency

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Overview

Weapon proficiency represents a character's training and skill with specific weapons. Characters are limited in the number of weapons they can use effectively, with penalties applied when using weapons they are not proficient with. This system encourages specialization and reflects the reality that mastering multiple weapons requires significant time and training.

## Basic Proficiency Rules

### Initial Weapon Proficiencies

Each character class receives a certain number of initial weapon proficiencies at 1st level:

| Character Class | Initial Proficiencies |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Fighter         | 4                    |
| Paladin         | 3                    |
| Ranger          | 3                    |
| Cleric          | 2                    |
| Druid           | 2                    |
| Magic-User      | 1                    |
| Illusionist     | 1                    |
| Thief           | 2                    |
| Assassin        | 3                    |
| Monk            | 2                    |
| Bard            | 2                    |

### Additional Proficiencies

Characters gain additional weapon proficiencies as they advance in level:

| Character Class | Additional Proficiency Every... |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Fighter         | 3 levels                       |
| Paladin         | 3 levels                       |
| Ranger          | 3 levels                       |
| Cleric          | 4 levels                       |
| Druid           | 4 levels                       |
| Magic-User      | 5 levels                       |

| Assassin        | 4 levels                       |
| Monk            | 4 levels                       |
| Bard            | 4 levels                       |

### Non-Proficiency Penalties

When a character uses a weapon they are not proficient with, they suffer a penalty to their attack rolls:

| Character Class | Non-Proficiency Penalty |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Fighter         | -2                      |
| Paladin         | -2                      |
| Ranger          | -2                      |
| Cleric          | -3                      |
| Druid           | -3                      |
| Magic-User      | -5                      |
| Illusionist     | -5                      |
| Thief           | -3                      |
| Assassin        | -3                      |
| Monk            | -3                      |
| Bard            | -2                      |

## Weapon Categories

For proficiency purposes, weapons are grouped into related categories. In some cases, proficiency in one weapon may grant partial proficiency in related weapons.

### Closely Related Weapons

Closely related weapons are similar enough that proficiency in one grants a reduced non-proficiency penalty when using the other:

| Weapon Group | Included Weapons | Penalty Reduction |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Swords, Light | Short sword, broad sword, scimitar | -1 instead of full penalty |
| Swords, Heavy | Long sword, bastard sword (1-handed) | -1 instead of full penalty |
| Axes | Hand axe, battle axe | -1 instead of full penalty |
| Pole Arms, Similar | Halberd, bardiche, voulge | -2 instead of full penalty |
| Flails/Hammers | Flail, hammer, mace | -2 instead of full penalty |
| Bows | Short bow, long bow | -2 instead of full penalty |
| Slings/Staves | Sling, quarterstaff | -2 instead of full penalty |

### Unrelated Weapons

Weapons that are not closely related provide no benefit from proficiency in other weapons. Some examples include:

- Dagger and any other weapon
- Two-handed sword and any other sword
- Crossbow and any bow
- Lance and any pole arm
- Specialized weapons (whip, net, etc.)

## Weapon Proficiency Selection

### Class Restrictions

Some classes have restrictions on which weapons they can select for proficiency:

- **Clerics**: Limited to bludgeoning weapons (club, flail, hammer, mace, staff)
- **Druids**: Limited to club, dagger, dart, hammer, scimitar, sling, spear, staff
- **Magic-Users**: Limited to dagger, dart, staff
- **Illusionists**: Limited to dagger, dart, staff
- **Monks**: Limited to bo stick, club, crossbow, dagger, hand axe, javelin, jo stick, pole arm, spear, staff
- **Other Classes**: Can select any weapon

### Racial Considerations

Some races have natural affinities for certain weapons:

- **Dwarves**: Receive +1 to hit with hammer, axe, or pick weapons
- **Elves**: Receive +1 to hit with bow (except crossbow) and sword
- **Gnomes**: Receive +1 to hit with hammer weapons
- **Halflings**: Receive +1 to hit with slings

These bonuses apply regardless of proficiency status.

## Weapon Specialization (Optional Rule)

Fighters (only) may specialize in a specific weapon, gaining significant bonuses at the cost of additional proficiency slots.

### Specialization Benefits

- **To Hit Bonus**: +1 to attack rolls with the specialized weapon
- **Damage Bonus**: +2 to damage rolls with the specialized weapon
- **Rate of Attack**: Improved rate of attack with the specialized weapon:
  - Levels 1-6: 3/2 attacks per round
  - Levels 7-12: 2 attacks per round
  - Levels 13+: 5/2 attacks per round

### Specialization Cost

- **Initial Specialization**: Costs 2 weapon proficiency slots
- **Double Specialization**: Costs 3 weapon proficiency slots total (optional rule)

### Double Specialization Benefits (Optional)

- **To Hit Bonus**: +3 to attack rolls
- **Damage Bonus**: +3 to damage rolls
- **Rate of Attack**: As single specialization, plus 1 additional attack per round

### Specialization Limitations

- Only one weapon may be specialized in
- Specialization must be selected at 1st level
- Ranged weapon specialization provides only +2 to hit, no damage bonus
- Some DMs may restrict specialization to certain weapons

## Gaining and Losing Proficiencies

### Training for New Proficiencies

When a character gains a new weapon proficiency through level advancement, they must train to use it effectively:

1. **Find a Teacher**: Must locate someone proficient in the desired weapon
2. **Training Time**: Requires 2-8 (2d4) weeks of training
3. **Training Cost**: 100-800 gp (1d8 × 100) for the training period
4. **Practice**: Must practice regularly to maintain proficiency

### Maintaining Proficiency

Characters must practice with their weapons periodically to maintain proficiency:

- At least 1 hour per week per weapon
- Combat use counts as practice
- Failure to practice for 1 month imposes a -1 penalty
- Failure to practice for 3 months imposes a -2 penalty
- Failure to practice for 6 months results in loss of proficiency

### Regaining Lost Proficiency

To regain a lost proficiency:

1. **Training Time**: Requires 1-4 (1d4) weeks of training
2. **Training Cost**: 50-400 gp (1d8 × 50)
3. **Practice**: Must resume regular practice schedule

## Multi-Class and Dual-Class Considerations

### Multi-Class Characters

Multi-class characters use the most favorable progression from their classes:

- Use the highest number of initial proficiencies
- Use the most favorable progression for additional proficiencies
- Use the lowest non-proficiency penalty

### Dual-Class Characters

Dual-class characters maintain their original proficiencies but gain new ones based on their new class:

- Retain all weapon proficiencies from the original class
- Gain new proficiencies at the rate of the new class
- Use the non-proficiency penalty of the class being actively used

## Weapon Proficiency and Combat

### Effects on Combat

Weapon proficiency affects several aspects of combat:

- **Attack Rolls**: Non-proficiency penalties apply to all attack rolls
- **Parrying**: Only proficient characters can effectively parry
- **Special Maneuvers**: Some special maneuvers require proficiency
- **Weapon Breakage**: Non-proficient use increases chance of weapon breakage by 5%

### Situational Modifiers

Certain situations may modify the effects of weapon proficiency:

- **Unfamiliar Weapons**: Exotic or unusual weapons may impose an additional -1 penalty
- **Superior Quality Weapons**: May reduce non-proficiency penalty by 1
- **Magical Weapons**: Intelligence of 12+ reduces non-proficiency penalty by 1
- **Combat Under Difficult Conditions**: May increase non-proficiency penalty by 1-2

## Weapon Mastery (Optional Advanced Rule)

Beyond specialization, fighters may achieve mastery with weapons through extensive training and experience.

### Levels of Mastery

1. **Proficient**: Normal use with no penalties
2. **Specialized**: As described in Weapon Specialization
3. **Expert**: +2 to hit, +3 damage, improved attack rate
4. **Master**: +3 to hit, +4 damage, further improved attack rate
5. **Grand Master**: +3 to hit, +5 damage, maximum attack rate, special abilities

### Requirements for Advanced Mastery

- **Expert**: Minimum 9th level fighter, 4 proficiency slots, special training
- **Master**: Minimum 12th level fighter, 5 proficiency slots, rare training
- **Grand Master**: Minimum 15th level fighter, 6 proficiency slots, exceptional training

### Special Abilities by Weapon Type

Different weapon types grant different special abilities at higher mastery levels:

- **Swords**: Improved critical hit range, disarming ability
- **Axes**: Armor penetration, shield splitting
- **Bludgeoning**: Stunning attacks, armor crushing
- **Pole Arms**: Set against charge, improved reach tactics
- **Bows**: Increased range, rapid fire, precision shots
- **Daggers**: Multiple attacks, vital strikes

## Weapon Proficiency Checks (Optional Rule)

In certain situations, the DM may call for a weapon proficiency check to determine success with special maneuvers or unusual uses of a weapon.

### Basic Check Procedure

1. Roll 1d20
2. Add proficiency modifiers:
   - Non-proficient: -4
   - Proficient: +0
   - Specialized: +2
   - Expert or higher: +4
3. Add ability modifiers (typically Strength or Dexterity)
4. Compare to target number set by DM (typically 15)

### Sample Proficiency Checks

- Disarming an opponent
- Cutting a rope with a thrown dagger
- Breaking a weapon with a two-handed sword
- Shooting a small target at extreme range
- Performing a trick shot or flourish
