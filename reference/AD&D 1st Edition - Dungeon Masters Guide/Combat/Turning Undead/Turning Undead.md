# Turning Undead

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Turning undead is a special ability possessed by clerics and paladins in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, allowing them to repel, control, or destroy undead creatures through the power of their faith. This section provides detailed information on turning undead and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling this unique aspect of the game.

## Nature of Turning Undead

Turning undead has the following characteristics:

- **Divine Power**: Turning undead is a manifestation of divine power channeled through the cleric or paladin, representing the triumph of life and faith over the forces of undeath.
- **Class Ability**: Turning undead is a special ability of clerics and paladins, with clerics being more effective at it than paladins of equivalent level.
- **Alignment Influence**: Good-aligned clerics turn (repel or destroy) undead, while evil-aligned clerics can command or control undead instead. Neutral clerics may choose whether to turn or command undead, but must be consistent in their choice.
- **Level-Based Effectiveness**: The effectiveness of turning undead depends on the level of the cleric or paladin and the type of undead being turned, with higher-level characters able to affect more powerful undead.
- **Limited Usage**: Turning undead can be attempted a limited number of times per day, typically once per encounter.

## Turning Undead Procedure

Turning undead follows a specific procedure:

1. **Declaration**: The player declares that their character is attempting to turn undead, specifying which undead creatures they are targeting if there are multiple types present.
2. **Presentation of Holy Symbol**: The character must present their holy symbol and speak prayers, invocations, or commands appropriate to their deity.
3. **Dice Roll**: The player rolls 2d10 and consults the turning undead table, comparing their character's level to the type of undead being turned.
4. **Result Determination**: Based on the dice roll and the table, the result is determined: failure, turning, or destruction of the undead.
5. **Effect Implementation**: If successful, the turned undead flee from the character for 3d4 rounds or until they cannot flee further, while destroyed undead are completely eliminated.

## The Turning Undead Table

The turning undead table shows the dice roll needed to turn or destroy different types of undead based on the cleric's level:

| Cleric Level | Skeleton | Zombie | Ghoul | Shadow | Wight | Ghast | Wraith | Mummy | Spectre | Vampire | Ghost | Lich | Special |
|--------------|----------|--------|-------|--------|-------|-------|--------|-------|---------|---------|-------|------|---------|
| 1            | 10       | 13     | 16    | 19     | 20    | -     | -      | -     | -       | -       | -     | -    | -       |
| 2            | 7        | 10     | 13    | 16     | 19    | 20    | -      | -     | -       | -       | -     | -    | -       |
| 3            | 4        | 7      | 10    | 13     | 16    | 19    | 20     | -     | -       | -       | -     | -    | -       |
| 4            | T        | 4      | 7     | 10     | 13    | 16    | 19     | 20    | -       | -       | -     | -    | -       |
| 5            | T        | T      | 4     | 7      | 10    | 13    | 16     | 19    | 20      | -       | -     | -    | -       |
| 6            | D        | T      | T     | 4      | 7     | 10    | 13     | 16    | 19      | 20      | -     | -    | -       |
| 7            | D        | D      | T     | T      | 4     | 7     | 10     | 13    | 16      | 19      | 20    | -    | -       |
| 8            | D        | D      | D     | T      | T     | 4     | 7      | 10    | 13      | 16      | 19    | 20   | -       |
| 9            | D        | D      | D     | D      | T     | T     | 4      | 7     | 10      | 13      | 16    | 19   | 20      |
| 10+          | D        | D      | D     | D      | D     | T     | T      | 4     | 7       | 10      | 13    | 16   | 19      |

In this table:
- A number indicates the minimum roll on 2d10 needed to turn the undead.
- "T" indicates that the undead is automatically turned.
- "D" indicates that the undead is automatically destroyed.
- "-" indicates that the cleric cannot turn that type of undead.

Paladins turn undead as clerics of two levels lower, so a 5th-level paladin turns undead as a 3rd-level cleric.

## Number of Undead Affected

When turning undead is successful, it affects a specific number of undead:

- **Turned Undead**: When undead are turned but not destroyed, the turning affects 2d6 undead of the targeted type. If more undead of that type are present than can be turned, those with the fewest hit dice are affected first.
- **Destroyed Undead**: When undead are destroyed, the destruction affects 2d4 undead of the targeted type. If more undead of that type are present than can be destroyed, those with the fewest hit dice are affected first.
- **Mixed Undead**: When facing mixed types of undead, the cleric or paladin must specify which type they are attempting to turn. Different types must be turned in separate attempts.
- **Unique Undead**: Unique or named undead, such as specific vampires or liches mentioned in the adventure, may receive bonuses to resist turning or may be immune to turning from lower-level clerics, at the DM's discretion.

## Behavior of Turned Undead

Turned undead behave in specific ways:

- **Fleeing**: Turned undead flee from the cleric or paladin at their maximum movement rate for 3d4 rounds, taking the most direct route away from the character.
- **Cornered Undead**: If turned undead cannot flee (due to being cornered, trapped, or otherwise unable to move away), they cower and cannot attack, though they may defend themselves if attacked.
- **Duration**: The turning effect lasts for 3d4 rounds, after which the undead may return if they still have reason to do so.
- **Breaking the Effect**: If the cleric or paladin who turned the undead attacks them while they are turned, the turning effect is broken for those undead that are attacked.
- **Command by Evil Clerics**: Undead commanded by evil clerics serve for 3d4 rounds plus the cleric's level in rounds, obeying the cleric's mental commands to the best of their ability.

## Special Turning Circumstances

Various special circumstances can affect turning undead:

- **Multiple Clerics**: If multiple clerics or paladins attempt to turn the same undead, only the most effective turning result applies. The attempts do not stack or combine.
- **Protection from Evil**: Undead affected by a protection from evil spell or similar effect may be more difficult to command for evil clerics, typically receiving a saving throw to resist the command.
- **Unholy Ground**: Attempts to turn undead in places of unholy power, such as desecrated temples or necropolises, may suffer penalties, while attempts to command undead in such places may receive bonuses.
- **Holy Ground**: Conversely, attempts to turn undead in places of holy power, such as consecrated temples or blessed ground, may receive bonuses, while attempts to command undead in such places may suffer penalties.
- **Artifacts and Relics**: Certain holy artifacts or relics may enhance a cleric's or paladin's ability to turn undead, providing bonuses to the turning roll or increasing the number of undead affected.

## Evil Clerics and Undead

Evil clerics interact with undead differently than good clerics:

- **Commanding Instead of Turning**: Evil clerics do not turn or destroy undead; instead, they command or control them, forcing them to serve the cleric's will.
- **Command Procedure**: The procedure for commanding undead is the same as for turning undead, using the same table and dice rolls, but with a different effect on success.
- **Commanded Behavior**: Undead commanded by an evil cleric serve the cleric for a limited time, obeying mental commands to the best of their ability. They will fight, guard, or perform other tasks as directed.
- **Intelligent Undead**: More intelligent undead, such as vampires or liches, may resent being commanded and may seek to subvert the cleric's orders or take revenge when the command effect ends.
- **Permanent Control**: Some evil clerics may seek to establish permanent control over undead through special rituals, unholy artifacts, or other means beyond the basic command undead ability.

## Neutral Clerics and Undead

Neutral clerics have a choice in how they interact with undead:

- **Turning or Commanding**: Neutral clerics must choose whether they will turn undead like good clerics or command undead like evil clerics. This choice should be consistent with the cleric's deity and philosophy.
- **Consistency Requirement**: Once a neutral cleric has chosen to turn or command undead, they should generally maintain that choice throughout their career, though the DM may allow a change if the cleric's alignment or religious focus shifts.
- **Effectiveness**: Neutral clerics are equally effective at turning or commanding undead as good or evil clerics of the same level, depending on which ability they have chosen.
- **Philosophical Implications**: The choice to turn or command undead has philosophical implications within the game world, potentially affecting how the cleric is perceived by others and their relationship with their deity.

## Conclusion

Turning undead is a distinctive and powerful ability that sets clerics and paladins apart from other character classes in the AD&D game. The DM should use these guidelines to handle turning undead in a way that is consistent with the game's rules while also reflecting the divine nature of the ability and its significance in the struggle between life and death. By understanding the procedures, limitations, and special circumstances of turning undead, the DM can create more engaging and thematically rich encounters involving undead creatures.
