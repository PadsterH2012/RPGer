# Unarmed Combat

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Overview

Unarmed combat encompasses all forms of physical conflict without weapons, including punching, wrestling, grappling, and martial arts. While less lethal than armed combat, unarmed fighting provides important tactical options for disarming, subduing, or restraining opponents.

## Basic Unarmed Attacks

| 6 | -2 |

## Unarmed Combat Tactics

### Against Armed Opponents

- Attempt to grapple or disarm rather than trading blows
- Use overbearing to knock opponent prone, then grapple
- Target the weapon arm specifically to neutralize the threat
- Multiple attackers should coordinate to overwhelm a single defender

### Against Spellcasters

- Target the head/mouth to prevent verbal components
- Grapple arms to prevent somatic components
- Maintain constant pressure to disrupt concentration
- Be aware that contact with the spellcaster may trigger touch spells

### Against Monsters

- Avoid unarmed combat with monsters significantly larger than human-sized
- Target vulnerable points when known (eyes, joints, etc.)
- Use the environment to gain advantage (higher ground, obstacles)
- Remember that many monsters have natural attacks far superior to human unarmed attacks
