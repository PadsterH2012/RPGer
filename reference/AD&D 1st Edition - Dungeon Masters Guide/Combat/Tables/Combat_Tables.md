1. Determine surprise (1d6 for each side)
2. Determine distance (2d6 × 10 feet outdoors, 2d6 × 10 yards indoors)
3. Determine initiative (1d6 for each side, modified by Dexterity and weapon speed)
4. Winning side acts:
   - Movement
   - Missile combat
   - Spell casting
   - Melee combat
5. Losing side acts:
   - Movement
   - Missile combat
   - Spell casting
