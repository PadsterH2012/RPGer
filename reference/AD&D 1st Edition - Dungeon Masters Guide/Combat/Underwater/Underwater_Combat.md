# Underwater Combat

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Overview

Combat beneath the surface of water presents unique challenges and limitations. The buoyancy, resistance, and visibility constraints of the underwater environment significantly alter how creatures move and fight. This document outlines the special rules and considerations for underwater combat in AD&D.

## Movement Underwater

### Basic Movement

- Characters and creatures without special swimming abilities move at 1/3 their normal movement rate underwater
- Characters with swimming proficiency move at 1/2 their normal movement rate
- Naturally swimming creatures (fish, aquatic monsters) use their full movement rate
- Creatures with magical swimming abilities (water breathing, etc.) move at 2/3 their normal rate

### Encumbrance Effects

- Heavily encumbered characters (plate mail, chain mail) sink at a rate of 60' per round unless actively swimming upward
- Medium encumbrance (scale mail, ring mail) causes sinking at 30' per round
- Light encumbrance (leather armor, no armor) allows neutral buoyancy with minimal effort
- Characters must drop heavy equipment to swim effectively

### Vertical Movement

- Swimming upward requires twice the movement cost of horizontal movement
- Swimming downward requires half the movement cost of horizontal movement
- Sinking is automatic for heavily encumbered characters but can be countered by swimming upward

## Weapon Use Underwater

### Weapon Restrictions

| Weapon Type | Effectiveness | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Slashing (swords, axes) | -2 to hit, half damage | Water resistance severely hampers swinging motions |
| Piercing (spears, daggers) | Normal | Most effective underwater weapons |
| Bludgeoning (maces, hammers) | -4 to hit, half damage | Extremely ineffective due to water resistance |
| Pole arms | Cannot be used | Too unwieldy in water |
| Flails/chains | Cannot be used | Too unwieldy in water |

### Missile Weapons

- **Thrown Weapons**: Maximum range of 10' underwater, -2 to hit
- **Mechanical Ranged Weapons**:
  - Crossbows: Function normally underwater but with maximum range of 30'
  - Bows: Cannot be used underwater
  - Slings: Cannot be used underwater
- **Specialized Underwater Weapons**:
  - Tridents: No penalties underwater
  - Spears: No penalties underwater
  - Daggers: No penalties underwater
  - Nets: -1 to hit underwater

### Special Weapon Considerations

- Metal weapons are subject to accelerated rusting if not properly maintained after underwater use
- Wooden weapons may become waterlogged, requiring additional maintenance
- Magical weapons are generally immune to these effects unless specified otherwise

## Armor and Protection

### Armor Effectiveness

- All armor provides normal AC protection underwater
- However, armor significantly impacts movement and buoyancy:
  - Plate mail: -6 to movement, causes rapid sinking
  - Chain mail: -4 to movement, causes sinking
  - Scale/ring mail: -3 to movement, neutral buoyancy difficult to maintain
  - Leather armor: -1 to movement, neutral buoyancy possible
  - No armor: No movement penalty, neutral buoyancy easy to maintain

### Shields

- Small shields can be used underwater with no penalty
- Medium shields impose a -1 penalty to attacks due to water resistance
- Large shields impose a -2 penalty to attacks and slow movement by an additional 1/3

## Combat Mechanics

### Initiative

- Initiative underwater is determined normally
- However, creatures with natural swimming ability gain a +1 bonus to initiative
- Characters in heavy armor suffer a -1 penalty to initiative

### Attack Rolls

- All non-aquatic creatures suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls underwater
- Aquatic creatures suffer no penalties
- Semi-aquatic creatures (amphibians, etc.) suffer only a -1 penalty
- These penalties are in addition to any weapon-specific penalties

### Damage

- Piercing weapons deal normal damage underwater
- Slashing weapons deal half damage (round down)
- Bludgeoning weapons deal half damage (round down)
- Critical hits function normally

### Special Combat Maneuvers

- **Grappling**: Functions normally underwater, but escape is easier (+2 to escape rolls)
- **Overbearing**: Not possible underwater due to lack of solid footing
- **Pummeling**: Damage reduced by half due to water resistance
- **Wrestling**: Functions normally but with a -1 penalty to success rolls

## Spell Casting Underwater

### Verbal Components

- Verbal components cannot be performed underwater without magical assistance
- Water breathing or similar magic allows verbal components to be performed normally
- Some aquatic creatures can vocalize underwater naturally

### Somatic Components

- Somatic components can be performed underwater but at half speed
- This effectively doubles the casting time for spells with somatic components
- Water resistance makes precise movements difficult

### Material Components

- Material components function normally underwater unless they are specifically fire-based
- Fire-based components (sulfur, phosphorus, etc.) cannot be used underwater
- Some material components may dissolve or be ruined when exposed to water

### Spell Effects

- **Fire Spells**: Most fire spells do not function underwater or function at greatly reduced effectiveness
  - Fireball creates a sphere of boiling water dealing half damage
  - Burning hands produces hot steam dealing 1 point of damage per level
  - Wall of fire cannot be created underwater
- **Lightning Spells**: Lightning spells affect a larger area underwater but may affect the caster
  - Lightning bolt affects all creatures within 20' of the bolt's path
  - Call lightning affects a sphere with radius 30' centered on the target
- **Cold Spells**: Cold spells function normally underwater
- **Force Spells**: Force spells function normally underwater

## Visibility and Detection

### Visibility Ranges

- Clear water: 100' visibility
- Murky water: 30' visibility
- Silty/muddy water: 10' visibility
- Ink cloud or similar: 1' visibility

### Light Sources

- Torches and lanterns do not function underwater
- Light spells function normally underwater
- Magical light sources function normally unless specified otherwise

### Detection

- Normal vision is limited by water clarity
- Infravision functions at half normal range underwater
- Ultravision functions normally underwater
- Detect magic and similar divination spells function normally

## Special Underwater Combat Situations

### Drowning

- Characters without water breathing ability can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to 1/3 their Constitution score
- After this time, they must make a Constitution check each round or begin drowning
- Drowning characters lose 1-6 hit points per round until rescued or dead
- Drowning characters automatically lose consciousness at 0 hit points

### Pressure Effects

- For every 100' of depth, characters suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to all actions
- At depths greater than 300', non-protected characters take 1d6 damage per round from pressure
- Magical protection (water breathing, etc.) typically includes protection from pressure effects

### Temperature Effects

- Cold water (below 50Â°F) causes 1-3 points of damage per turn without proper protection
- Characters in cold water must make a Constitution check every turn or suffer a -1 penalty to all actions
- These penalties are cumulative and last until the character can warm up

## Underwater Combat Tactics

### For Land-Dwellers

- Rely on piercing weapons (spears, daggers, tridents)
- Avoid heavy armor if possible
- Secure magical protection (water breathing, freedom of movement)
- Use the environment (coral, underwater caves) for tactical advantage
- Retreat to the surface when possible

### For Aquatic Creatures

- Use superior mobility to attack and retreat
- Target spellcasters first to prevent magical threats
- Use ink clouds or silt clouds to obscure vision
- Attack from below or behind
- Use constriction or grappling attacks against armored opponents

## Underwater Monsters and Their Tactics

### Common Underwater Threats

- **Sahuagin**: Use coordinated pack tactics and tridents
- **Kuo-Toa**: Employ sticky shields to trap weapons and use specialized barbed spears
- **Locathah**: Use nets and spears in group formations
- **Mermen**: Employ tridents and distance tactics
- **Aquatic Elves**: Use sophisticated tactics and underwater magic

### Unique Underwater Hazards

- **Giant Octopi/Squid**: Constriction attacks and ink clouds
- **Marine Predators**: Sharks, barracuda, etc. are attracted to blood in the water
- **Water Elementals**: Can create whirlpools and control water currents
- **Underwater Undead**: Drowned ones, lacedons (aquatic ghouls) may lurk in shipwrecks
