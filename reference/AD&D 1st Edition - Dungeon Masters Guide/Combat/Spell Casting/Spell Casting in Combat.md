# Spell Casting in Combat

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Spell casting in combat is a crucial aspect of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, allowing spellcasters to use their magical abilities in battle. This section provides detailed information on spell casting in combat and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling this complex aspect of the game.

## Spell Casting Procedure

Spell casting in combat follows a specific procedure:

1. **Declaration**: The player declares which spell their character will cast during the declaration phase of the combat round.
2. **Initiative Determination**: Initiative is rolled to determine the order of actions within the round.
3. **Casting Time**: The spell's casting time determines when in the round the spell takes effect. Casting time is typically expressed in segments (1/10 of a round), with longer casting times delaying the spell's effect.
4. **Component Use**: The caster must be able to speak (for verbal components), move their hands (for somatic components), and access any required material components to cast the spell.
5. **Concentration**: The caster must maintain concentration throughout the casting time. Interruptions can disrupt the spell.
6. **Spell Effect**: If the casting is successful, the spell takes effect according to its description, potentially requiring attack rolls, saving throws, or other resolution mechanics.

## Casting Time and Initiative

Casting time significantly affects when spells take effect in combat:

- **Segments**: Casting time is measured in segments, with each segment representing 1/10 of a combat round (approximately 6 seconds).
- **Initiative Modification**: The spell takes effect in the segment determined by adding the casting time to the caster's initiative roll. For example, a spell with a casting time of 3 cast by a character with an initiative roll of 2 would take effect in segment 5 of the round.
- **Full-Round Casting**: Spells with casting times longer than 10 segments take multiple rounds to cast, with the effect occurring in the appropriate segment of the final round.
- **Delayed Effect**: Some spells have delayed effects even after casting is complete, as specified in their descriptions.

## Spell Disruption

Spell casting can be disrupted in various ways:

- **Taking Damage**: If a spellcaster takes damage during the casting of a spell, the spell is disrupted and lost. The caster must make a concentration check (typically a saving throw vs. spells) to avoid disruption.
- **Physical Interference**: If a spellcaster is physically interfered with during casting, such as being grappled, pushed, or having their components stolen, the spell may be disrupted.
- **Magical Interference**: Certain magical effects, such as silence for spells with verbal components or anti-magic fields, can prevent spell casting or disrupt spells in progress.
- **Environmental Factors**: Extreme environmental conditions, such as high winds for spells with material components or underwater conditions for spells with verbal components, can make spell casting difficult or impossible.
- **Distractions**: Significant distractions, as determined by the DM, may require concentration checks to avoid spell disruption.

## Counterspelling

Counterspelling is the practice of using one spell to negate another:

- **Direct Counterspelling**: A spellcaster can use the same spell or its reverse to directly counter an opponent's spell. For example, a fireball can be countered by another fireball, or light can be countered by darkness.
- **Dispel Magic**: The dispel magic spell can be used to counter any spell being cast, with a chance of success based on the relative levels of the casters.
- **Timing**: To counter a spell, the counterspell must be cast in the same segment that the original spell would take effect. This typically requires the counterspelling caster to have prepared an action to counter a spell.
- **Recognition**: To counter a spell, the counterspelling caster must recognize what spell is being cast. This may require a spellcraft check or similar roll, particularly for spells with subtle components.
- **Specific Countermeasures**: Some spells have specific countermeasures mentioned in their descriptions, such as how gust of wind can disperse a cloudkill spell.

## Spell Components in Combat

The components of spells can raise specific issues in combat:

- **Verbal Components**: Verbal components must be spoken aloud, which can alert enemies to the casting of a spell and cannot be performed in areas of magical silence or underwater without magical assistance.
- **Somatic Components**: Somatic components require precise hand gestures, which cannot be performed while bound, paralyzed, or in restrictive armor. Some DMs may rule that somatic components require both hands to be free.
- **Material Components**: Material components must be held or manipulated during casting, which requires at least one hand to be free. Some material components are consumed in the casting, while others are not.
- **Focus Items**: Some spells require focus items, which are not consumed but must be held or touched during casting.
- **Component Pouches**: Many spellcasters use component pouches to keep their material components organized and accessible. Drawing a component from a pouch typically requires a free hand and may take a segment of time.

## Spell Targeting in Combat

Targeting spells in combat involves several considerations:

- **Line of Sight**: Many spells require the caster to see the target. Obstacles, darkness, invisibility, or other visual impediments can prevent targeting.
- **Line of Effect**: Some spells require a clear path from the caster to the target, not just visual contact. Physical barriers can block line of effect even if the target is visible.
- **Range**: Each spell has a range, beyond which it cannot be targeted. Range is typically expressed in inches, with each inch representing 10 feet indoors or 10 yards outdoors.
- **Area of Effect**: Spells with areas of effect, such as fireballs or lightning bolts, affect all targets within the specified area. The DM must determine which creatures or objects fall within the area.
- **Moving Targets**: Targeting moving creatures with spells can be challenging, particularly for spells with longer casting times. The DM may impose penalties or require attack rolls for spells targeted at fast-moving creatures.

## Specific Spell Types in Combat

Different types of spells have specific considerations in combat:

- **Attack Spells**: Spells that directly damage opponents, such as magic missile or fireball, are straightforward to resolve but may allow saving throws for reduced damage.
- **Control Spells**: Spells that control or restrict opponents, such as hold person or web, can be powerful but typically allow saving throws and may have limitations on what creatures they can affect.
- **Summoning Spells**: Spells that summon creatures, such as monster summoning or conjure elemental, bring allies to the battle but typically have casting times that delay their effect.
- **Enhancement Spells**: Spells that enhance the caster or allies, such as haste or strength, can provide significant advantages but may have limited durations or side effects.
- **Utility Spells**: Spells with utility functions, such as knock or fly, may not seem combat-oriented but can be used creatively in battle to gain advantages.

## Spell Casting Tactics

Various tactical considerations apply to spell casting in combat:

- **Positioning**: Spellcasters should position themselves to maximize their spells' effectiveness while minimizing their vulnerability, typically staying behind frontline fighters.
- **Spell Selection**: The choice of which spell to cast should consider the specific situation, including the number and type of opponents, the environment, and the status of allies.
- **Timing**: The timing of spell casting is crucial, with some spells being more effective at the beginning of combat (such as area damage spells) and others later (such as healing spells).
- **Protection**: Spellcasters should seek protection while casting, particularly for spells with longer casting times, to avoid disruption.
- **Concentration**: Maintaining concentration in chaotic combat situations can be challenging, so spellcasters should minimize distractions and potential interruptions.

## Conclusion

Spell casting in combat adds a powerful and dynamic element to the AD&D game, providing spellcasters with a wide range of options beyond physical attacks. The DM should use these guidelines to handle spell casting in a way that is fair, consistent, and reflective of the magical nature of the game world. By understanding the procedures, limitations, and tactical considerations of combat spell casting, the DM can create more engaging and balanced encounters that allow spellcasters to shine while maintaining appropriate challenges.
