# Non-Lethal Combat

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Non-lethal combat in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game involves conflicts where the goal is to subdue, capture, or otherwise incapacitate opponents without killing them. This section provides detailed information on non-lethal combat and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling these situations.

## Types of Non-Lethal Combat

There are several types of non-lethal combat in the AD&D game:

- **Subdual Combat**: Combat where the attacker specifically declares they are attempting to subdue rather than kill the opponent, typically using the flat of a blade, a club, or other weapons in a less lethal manner.
- **Grappling**: Physical wrestling or grabbing, where the goal is to restrain, immobilize, or throw the opponent rather than cause injury.
- **Overbearing**: Using body weight and strength to knock down and pin an opponent.
- **Pummeling**: Using fists, feet, or other body parts to strike an opponent with the goal of knocking them unconscious rather than causing lethal damage.
- **Restraint**: Using ropes, chains, nets, or similar items to bind and immobilize an opponent.
- **Disarming**: Removing an opponent's weapon to render them less dangerous without necessarily causing them harm.

## Subdual Combat

Subdual combat follows specific rules:

- **Declaration**: The player or DM must declare that they are attempting to subdue rather than kill before making the attack roll.
- **Attack Penalty**: Attacks made to subdue typically suffer a -4 penalty to the attack roll, reflecting the difficulty of striking to incapacitate rather than to wound.
- **Damage Type**: Damage inflicted in subdual combat is tracked separately from normal damage and is referred to as "subdual damage" or "non-lethal damage."
- **Unconsciousness**: When subdual damage equals or exceeds the target's current hit points, the target falls unconscious but is not dying or dead.
- **Recovery**: Subdual damage recovers more quickly than normal damage, typically at a rate of 1 point per hour of rest.
- **Conversion to Lethal**: At the DM's discretion, a portion of subdual damage (such as 25% or 50%) may convert to normal damage, reflecting the fact that even non-lethal attacks can cause some lasting injury.

## Grappling

Grappling involves wrestling or grabbing an opponent:

- **Attack Roll**: To initiate a grapple, the attacker makes an attack roll against the target's Armor Class, with the target's Dexterity bonus (if any) still applying but with armor providing less protection (the DM may rule that only magical bonuses from armor apply).
- **Strength Contest**: If the attack roll succeeds, the attacker and defender engage in a Strength contest, typically comparing their Strength scores or making opposed Strength checks.
- **Success Results**: If the attacker wins the Strength contest, they successfully grapple the defender, who becomes grappled (restrained).
- **Grappled Condition**: A grappled creature has limited movement and actions, typically being unable to move and suffering penalties to attacks and other physical actions.
- **Breaking Free**: A grappled creature can attempt to break free by winning a Strength contest against the grappler on their turn.
- **Multiple Grapplers**: Multiple attackers can grapple a single target, with each successful grappler providing cumulative advantages in the Strength contests.

## Overbearing

Overbearing involves knocking down and pinning an opponent:

- **Charge Requirement**: Overbearing typically requires a charge of at least 10 feet to build momentum.
- **Attack Roll**: The attacker makes an attack roll against the target's Armor Class, with similar modifications as for grappling.
- **Size Factors**: The relative size of the attacker and defender significantly affects overbearing attempts, with larger creatures having advantages against smaller ones.
- **Success Results**: If the attack succeeds, the defender is knocked prone and may be pinned, depending on the specific circumstances and the attacker's follow-up actions.
- **Prone Condition**: A prone creature suffers penalties to attacks and provides advantages to attackers who are adjacent to them, while having advantages against ranged attacks.
- **Recovery**: A prone creature can typically stand up by spending movement, though this may provoke attacks of opportunity in certain circumstances.

## Pummeling

Pummeling involves striking with fists, feet, or other body parts:

- **Attack Roll**: The attacker makes an attack roll against the target's Armor Class, with armor providing less protection (as with grappling).
- **Damage**: Successful pummeling attacks typically deal 1d2, 1d3, or 1d4 points of subdual damage, depending on the attacker's size and strength.
- **Strength Bonus**: Strength bonuses to damage apply to pummeling attacks, potentially increasing the damage significantly for strong characters.
- **Monk Exception**: Monks, with their specialized training in unarmed combat, follow different rules for pummeling, dealing more damage and potentially causing lethal rather than subdual damage.
- **Improvised Weapons**: Small improvised weapons, such as brass knuckles or saps, may increase pummeling damage or provide other advantages.
- **Knockout**: As with other forms of subdual damage, when pummeling damage equals or exceeds the target's current hit points, the target falls unconscious.

## Restraint

Restraint involves binding an opponent with ropes, chains, or similar items:

- **Prior Incapacitation**: Typically, a creature must be incapacitated, unconscious, or otherwise at a significant disadvantage before restraints can be applied effectively.
- **Application Time**: Applying restraints takes time, typically 1-3 rounds depending on the type of restraint and the specific circumstances.
- **Escape Attempts**: Restrained creatures can attempt to escape by making Strength checks (to break the restraints) or Dexterity checks (to slip free), with the difficulty depending on the quality and type of the restraints.
- **Cutting Free**: Restraints made of destructible materials, such as rope, can be cut by those with edged weapons, typically requiring 1-3 rounds depending on the restraint's strength.
- **Magical Restraints**: Magical restraints, such as those created by a hold person spell or similar magic, follow the rules specified in the spell description rather than the general restraint rules.

## Disarming

Disarming involves removing an opponent's weapon:

- **Attack Roll**: The attacker makes an attack roll against the target's Armor Class, typically with a penalty of -4 to reflect the difficulty of targeting a weapon rather than the wielder.
- **Opposed Roll**: If the attack roll succeeds, the attacker and defender make opposed rolls, typically using their attack bonuses with the relevant weapons or a combination of Strength and Dexterity.
- **Success Results**: If the attacker wins the opposed roll, the defender's weapon is knocked 1d10 feet away in a random direction.
- **Weapon Size Factors**: The relative size of the weapons involved affects disarming attempts, with larger weapons having advantages against smaller ones.
- **Two-Handed Grip**: Defenders using two hands to hold their weapon typically receive a bonus to resist disarming attempts.
- **Secured Weapons**: Weapons that are secured to the wielder, such as by a wrist strap or similar device, may be more difficult to disarm or may remain attached to the wielder even if disarmed.

## Special Considerations for Non-Lethal Combat

Various special considerations apply to non-lethal combat:

- **Creature Type Limitations**: Some creature types, such as undead, constructs, or oozes, may be immune or resistant to certain forms of non-lethal combat due to their nature.
- **Size Disparities**: Significant size disparities between combatants can make some forms of non-lethal combat impractical or impossible, such as a human attempting to grapple a dragon.
- **Multiple Attackers**: Multiple attackers can coordinate non-lethal combat efforts, such as some attempting to grapple while others attempt to pummel or disarm.
- **Environmental Factors**: The environment can affect non-lethal combat, such as slippery surfaces making grappling more difficult or confined spaces limiting movement options.
- **Magical Assistance**: Various spells and magical items can assist in non-lethal combat, such as hold person for restraint or grease for making grappling more difficult.

## Conclusion

Non-lethal combat adds depth and variety to the AD&D game, providing alternatives to lethal violence and creating opportunities for capture, interrogation, or mercy. The DM should use these guidelines to handle non-lethal combat in a way that is fair, consistent, and reflective of the specific circumstances of each situation. By understanding the different types of non-lethal combat and their rules, the DM can create more diverse and nuanced combat encounters that offer players meaningful choices beyond simply killing their opponents.
