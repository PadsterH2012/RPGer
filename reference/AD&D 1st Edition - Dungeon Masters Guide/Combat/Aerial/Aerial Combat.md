# Aerial Combat

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Aerial combat in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game involves battles that take place in the air, whether through flight spells, flying mounts, or natural flight abilities. This section provides detailed information on aerial combat and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling these complex encounters.

## Nature of Aerial Combat

Aerial combat has several distinctive characteristics:

- **Three-Dimensional Movement**: Unlike ground combat, aerial combat takes place in three dimensions, with combatants able to move up, down, and in any horizontal direction.
- **Maneuverability Classes**: Flying creatures and characters have maneuverability classes that determine how well they can turn, climb, dive, and perform other aerial maneuvers.
- **Speed Factors**: The speed at which a creature or character flies affects their tactical options, with faster flyers able to outrun slower ones but potentially having less maneuverability.
- **Altitude Considerations**: The altitude at which combat takes place can affect visibility, oxygen availability, temperature, and other factors that influence the battle.
- **Falling Danger**: Characters or creatures that lose the ability to fly during aerial combat face the additional danger of falling, potentially taking significant damage.

## Maneuverability Classes

Flying creatures and characters are categorized into five maneuverability classes:

- **Class A (Perfect)**: These flyers can hover, turn 180 degrees in place, and move in any direction with perfect control. Examples include air elementals, djinn, and characters using the fly spell.
- **Class B (Good)**: These flyers can hover, turn 90 degrees in a 5-foot radius, and move with good control. Examples include pegasi, sphinxes, and most small flying creatures.
- **Class C (Average)**: These flyers cannot hover, can turn 60 degrees in a 10-foot radius, and have average control. Examples include griffons, hippogriffs, and most medium-sized flying creatures.
- **Class D (Poor)**: These flyers cannot hover, can turn 30 degrees in a 30-foot radius, and have poor control. Examples include dragons, wyverns, and most large flying creatures.
- **Class E (Clumsy)**: These flyers cannot hover, can turn 30 degrees in a 60-foot radius, and have clumsy control. Examples include rocs, giant eagles, and most very large flying creatures.

## Movement in Aerial Combat

Movement in aerial combat follows specific rules:

- **Movement Rate**: Each flying creature or character has a movement rate, typically expressed in inches, which represents how far they can move in one round. In outdoor settings, each inch equals 10 yards, so a movement rate of 12" allows movement of 120 yards per round.
- **Minimum Forward Speed**: Creatures with maneuverability classes C, D, and E must maintain a minimum forward speed to stay airborne. If they move less than half their movement rate in a round, they begin to lose altitude.
- **Maximum Speed**: Creatures can move up to their full movement rate in a round, or potentially faster if diving.
- **Climbing and Diving**: Climbing (moving upward) typically reduces forward speed, while diving (moving downward) can increase it. The specific effects depend on the creature's maneuverability class.
- **Turning**: The ability to change direction is determined by the creature's maneuverability class, with more maneuverable flyers able to make sharper turns.

## Aerial Combat Tactics

Various tactical considerations apply to aerial combat:

- **Altitude Advantage**: Having a higher altitude than an opponent provides tactical advantages, including the ability to dive for increased speed and attack bonuses, and the option to disengage by climbing away.
- **Sun Position**: Positioning with the sun behind you can make it difficult for opponents to see you clearly, potentially imposing penalties on their attacks.
- **Diving Attacks**: Diving attacks, where a flyer descends rapidly to attack an opponent, can provide bonuses to hit and damage due to the increased momentum.
- **Strafing Runs**: Fast flyers can perform strafing runs, moving past opponents while attacking and continuing beyond their reach, then turning for another pass.
- **Hovering Attacks**: Flyers with the ability to hover (maneuverability classes A and B) can remain stationary while attacking, which can be particularly effective for spellcasting.
- **Formation Flying**: Groups of flyers can adopt formations that provide mutual protection and coordinated attacks, similar to ground-based military formations.

## Aerial Combat Procedure

Aerial combat follows a procedure similar to ground combat, with some additional considerations:

1. **Surprise Determination**: The DM determines whether either side is surprised, considering factors such as visibility, altitude, and the approach direction.
2. **Distance Determination**: The DM determines the initial distance between the opposing sides, considering the three-dimensional nature of aerial combat.
3. **Initiative Determination**: Each side rolls for initiative to determine the order of actions within the round.
4. **Declaration of Actions**: Players declare what actions their characters will take during the round, and the DM determines what actions NPCs and creatures will take.
5. **Movement**: Characters and creatures move according to their movement rates and maneuverability classes, considering climbing, diving, and turning limitations.
6. **Attacks**: Attacks are resolved using the standard combat rules, with modifications for aerial combat situations such as diving attacks or attacks against targets at different altitudes.
7. **End of Round**: After all actions have been resolved, the round ends, and a new round begins with a new initiative roll if combat continues.

## Special Aerial Combat Situations

Various special situations can arise in aerial combat:

- **Mounted Aerial Combat**: Characters riding flying mounts must consider both their own actions and the control of their mounts. Controlling a mount in combat typically requires a successful riding check, with failure potentially resulting in the mount acting unpredictably.
- **Spellcasting in Flight**: Casting spells while flying can be challenging, particularly for spells with somatic components. The DM may impose penalties or require concentration checks for spellcasting in flight, especially for flyers with poor maneuverability.
- **Aerial Archery**: Using missile weapons in aerial combat involves additional considerations, such as the relative movement of the attacker and target, the effects of altitude and wind, and the limited stability of an aerial platform.
- **Aerial Melee**: Melee combat in the air is typically brief and dynamic, with combatants moving past each other rather than remaining engaged. The DM may allow only a single attack as flyers pass each other, unless they have the ability to hover.
- **Falling**: Characters or creatures that lose the ability to fly during aerial combat will fall, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen (maximum 20d6). The DM may allow saving throws or ability checks to reduce this damage or to grab onto something to arrest the fall.

## Environmental Factors in Aerial Combat

Various environmental factors can affect aerial combat:

- **Weather Conditions**: Wind, rain, snow, fog, and other weather conditions can affect visibility, movement, and combat effectiveness in the air. Strong winds may impose penalties on movement and attacks, while precipitation can reduce visibility and make flying more difficult.
- **Altitude Effects**: At very high altitudes, the air becomes thin, potentially affecting breathing, spellcasting, and physical exertion. Characters may suffer penalties or require magical protection to function effectively at extreme altitudes.
- **Terrain Interaction**: The terrain below can affect aerial combat, providing obstacles to avoid, cover for ground-based attackers, or potential landing spots. Flying close to the ground or near obstacles requires more careful maneuvering.
- **Time of Day**: The time of day affects visibility and potentially temperature, with night flying being particularly challenging without darkvision or magical light sources.
- **Magical Effects**: Various magical effects, such as wind wall, control weather, or obscuring mist, can significantly affect aerial combat conditions.

## Conclusion

Aerial combat adds a complex and dynamic dimension to the AD&D game, providing unique tactical challenges and opportunities. The DM should use these guidelines to handle aerial combat in a way that is exciting and fair, while also considering the specific circumstances of each situation. By understanding the principles of aerial movement, maneuverability, and tactics, the DM can create memorable aerial encounters that reward player skill and creative thinking.
