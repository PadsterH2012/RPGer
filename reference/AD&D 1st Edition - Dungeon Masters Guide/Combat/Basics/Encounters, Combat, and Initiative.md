# Encounters, Combat, and Initiative

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide (Pages 61-83)*

## Overview

Combat is divided into 1-minute period melee rounds, or simply rounds, in order to have reasonably manageable combat. "Manageable" applies both to the actions of the combatants and to the actual refereeing of such melees. It would be no great task to devise an elaborate set of rules for highly complex individual combats with rounds of but a few seconds length. It is not in the best interests of an adventure game, however, to delve too deeply into cut and thrust, parry and riposte. The location of a hit or wound, the sort of damage done, sprains, breaks, and dislocations are not the stuff of heroic fantasy.

As has been detailed, hit points are not actually a measure of physical damage, by and large, as far as characters (and some other creatures as well) are concerned. Therefore, the location of hits and the type of damage caused are not germane to them. While this is not true with respect to most monsters, it is neither necessary nor particularly useful. Combat is a common pursuit in the vast majority of adventures, and the participants in the campaign deserve a chance to exercise intelligent choice during such confrontations. As hit points dwindle they can opt to break off the encounter and attempt to flee.

## Combat Procedure

The steps for encounter and combat are as follows:

1. Determine if either or both parties are surprised.
2. Determine distance, if unknown, between the parties.
3. If both parties are unsurprised, or equally surprised, determine INITIATIVE for that round.
4. Determine the results of whatever actions are decided upon by the party with initiative:
   - Avoid engagement (flee, slam door, use magic to escape, etc.) if possible.
   - Attempt to parley.
   - Await action by other party.
   - Discharge missiles or magical device attacks or cast spells or turn undead.
   - Close to striking range, or charge.
   - Set weapons against possible opponent charge.
   - Strike blows with weapons, to kill or subdue.
   - Grapple or hold.
5. Determine the results of whatever actions are decided upon by the party which lost the initiative.
6. Continue each melee round by determination of distance, initiative, and action until melee ends due to fleeing, inability to continue, or death of one or both parties.

## Surprise

The term surprise is basically self-explanatory. A surprised party is caught unawares or unprepared. In such circumstances the non-surprised (or less-surprised) party has an immediate advantage which is reflected in the granting of 1 or more segments of initiative, during which the active (non-surprised) party can perform actions while the surprised party cannot.

### Determining Surprise

Surprise is determined by rolling a six-sided die for each party at the beginning of an encounter. A roll of 1, 2, or 3 indicates the party is surprised. If both parties are surprised, the difference between the dice rolled indicates the number of segments of surprise gained by the party with the lower score.

### Effects of Surprise

When a party is surprised, they lose a number of segments equal to the surprise dice result. During these segments, the non-surprised party can act freely, potentially getting extra attacks or actions before normal combat begins.

A surprised party:
- Cannot move
- Cannot attack
- Cannot cast spells
- Cannot use magical items
- Cannot use any special abilities

## Initiative

Initiative is determined at the start of each combat round. Each party rolls a six-sided die, and the higher scoring party has the initiative and acts first during the round. If both parties roll the same number, all actions are considered to be simultaneous.

### Initiative Modifiers

Various factors can affect initiative determination:
- Weapon length (longer weapons may strike first)
- Dexterity (high dexterity may improve initiative)
- Situation (position, preparation, etc.)

For dexterity, the following modifiers apply:
- Dexterity 3 or less: -2 on initiative die
- Dexterity 4-6: -1 on initiative die
- Dexterity 7-14: no modifier
- Dexterity 15-16: +1 on initiative die
- Dexterity 17-18: +2 on initiative die

## Actions During Combat

During a combat round, characters may perform various actions:

### Movement
Characters can move up to their movement rate during a combat round. Movement can be split before and after an attack.

### Attacking
Characters can make melee or missile attacks based on their class and level. Some creatures may have multiple attacks per round.

### Spell Casting
Spell casters can cast spells during combat, but they must remain relatively motionless and undisturbed during the casting time.

### Using Magical Items
Characters can use magical items such as wands, staves, and other devices during combat.

### Other Actions
Characters may perform other actions such as drinking potions, changing weapons, or using special abilities.

The exact actions possible depend on the character's class, position, and situation.
