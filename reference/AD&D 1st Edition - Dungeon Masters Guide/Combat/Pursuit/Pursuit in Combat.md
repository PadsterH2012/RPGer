# Pursuit in Combat

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Pursuit in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game occurs when one group attempts to chase and catch another group that is fleeing. This section provides detailed information on pursuit in and after combat and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling these dynamic situations.

## Initiating Pursuit

Pursuit typically begins in one of the following ways:

- **Failed Morale**: When non-player characters (NPCs) or monsters fail a morale check, they may flee, potentially initiating pursuit if the player characters decide to chase them.
- **Tactical Retreat**: A group may make a deliberate tactical retreat, withdrawing from combat in an orderly manner to a more advantageous position or to conserve resources.
- **Mission Objective**: Pursuit may be part of a mission objective, such as capturing a fleeing villain, recovering a stolen item, or preventing an enemy from reaching reinforcements.
- **Encounter Avoidance**: One group may attempt to avoid an encounter entirely by fleeing before combat begins, leading to pursuit if the other group decides to give chase.
- **Pursuit Declaration**: The pursuing group must declare their intention to pursue, either through player announcement or DM decision for NPCs.

## Factors Affecting Pursuit

Several factors affect the likelihood of successful pursuit:

- **Movement Rates**: The relative movement rates of the pursuing and fleeing groups are crucial. If the pursuing group is faster, pursuit is more likely to succeed. If the fleeing group is faster, pursuit is less likely to succeed.
- **Encumbrance**: The encumbrance of both groups affects their movement rates and thus the outcome of pursuit. Heavily encumbered characters move more slowly, while unencumbered characters can move at their full rate.
- **Terrain**: The nature of the terrain affects pursuit:
  - **Open Terrain**: Pursuit in open terrain is straightforward, with movement rates being the primary factor.
  - **Dense Vegetation**: Pursuit in dense vegetation can be more difficult, with the possibility of losing sight of the fleeing group.
  - **Rough Terrain**: Pursuit in rough terrain can favor those more familiar with the area or those with special movement abilities.
  - **Urban Environment**: Pursuit in urban environments involves considerations such as crowds, buildings, and knowledge of the area.
- **Visibility Conditions**: Conditions that limit visibility, such as darkness, fog, or precipitation, generally make pursuit more difficult.
- **Special Abilities**: Special abilities can affect pursuit, such as the ability to fly, climb, swim, turn invisible, or move silently.

## Pursuit Procedure

Pursuit follows a specific procedure:

1. **Pursuit Declaration**: The pursuing group declares their intention to pursue, either through player announcement or DM decision for NPCs.
2. **Initial Pursuit Check**: An initial check is made to determine whether the pursuit begins successfully or whether the fleeing group escapes immediately. This check is influenced by factors such as surprise, initial distance, and the environment.
3. **Pursuit Round**: If the initial pursuit check indicates that pursuit continues, the situation is resolved in pursuit rounds, each representing a period of time appropriate to the environment (such as 1 turn in a dungeon or 1 hour in wilderness).
4. **Movement Calculation**: During each pursuit round, the distance between the groups is calculated based on their movement rates and any modifiers from terrain, encumbrance, or special circumstances.
5. **Pursuit Termination**: Pursuit continues until one of the following occurs:
   - The fleeing group successfully escapes, either by outrunning the pursuers or by successfully hiding or otherwise breaking contact.
   - The pursuing group catches up to the fleeing group, resulting in an encounter.
   - The pursuing group abandons the pursuit, either due to losing track of the fleeing group, exhaustion, or changing priorities.

## Pursuit in Dungeons

Pursuit in dungeon environments has specific considerations:

- **Limited Visibility**: Dungeons typically have limited visibility due to darkness, requiring light sources that can reveal the pursuers' position.
- **Complex Layout**: The complex layout of dungeons, with corridors, rooms, intersections, and doors, creates opportunities for the fleeing group to hide, set ambushes, or take unexpected routes.
- **Doors and Obstacles**: Doors, portcullises, traps, and other obstacles can be used by the fleeing group to slow down pursuers.
- **Noise Considerations**: Noise echoes in dungeons, potentially alerting other denizens to the pursuit and complicating the situation.
- **Pursuit Time**: In dungeons, pursuit rounds typically represent 1 turn (10 minutes) of game time, reflecting the cautious movement and navigation required.

## Pursuit in Wilderness

Pursuit in wilderness environments has different considerations:

- **Extended Distances**: Wilderness pursuit can cover much larger distances than dungeon pursuit, potentially spanning many miles.
- **Terrain Variety**: Wilderness terrain can vary significantly, from open plains to dense forests to mountains, each affecting movement rates and tracking difficulty.
- **Weather Factors**: Weather conditions, such as rain, snow, or fog, can affect both movement rates and the ability to track the fleeing group.
- **Tracking Skills**: The tracking skills of the pursuing group, particularly rangers or others with wilderness expertise, become crucial in wilderness pursuit.
- **Pursuit Time**: In wilderness, pursuit rounds typically represent 1 hour of game time, reflecting the extended nature of wilderness travel.

## Pursuit in Urban Environments

Pursuit in urban environments presents unique challenges:

- **Crowds and Bystanders**: Urban areas typically have crowds and bystanders that can impede pursuit or be used by the fleeing group to blend in and escape.
- **Complex Street Layout**: The complex layout of streets, alleys, buildings, and other urban features provides many options for the fleeing group to change direction or hide.
- **Vertical Dimension**: Urban environments often have a vertical dimension, with rooftops, balconies, and multiple building levels that can be used in pursuit.
- **Local Knowledge**: Knowledge of the local area can provide significant advantages in urban pursuit, allowing for shortcuts or knowledge of hiding places.
- **Legal Considerations**: Urban pursuit may have legal implications, with city guards or other authorities potentially becoming involved.

## Specific Pursuit Tactics

Both pursuing and fleeing groups can employ various tactics:

### Pursuing Group Tactics
- **Splitting Up**: The pursuing group may split up to cover multiple possible routes or to flank the fleeing group.
- **Using High Ground**: The pursuing group may use high ground to gain a better view of the surrounding area, potentially spotting the fleeing group.
- **Cutting Off**: The pursuing group may attempt to cut off the fleeing group by taking shortcuts or anticipating their route.
- **Tracking**: The pursuing group may use tracking skills to follow the fleeing group's trail, particularly in wilderness environments.
- **Magical Assistance**: The pursuing group may use magic to aid their pursuit, such as spells that increase movement rate, reveal tracks, or allow them to see invisible creatures.

### Fleeing Group Tactics
- **False Trails**: The fleeing group may create false trails to mislead pursuers, such as by splitting up temporarily and then rejoining, or by using magic or special abilities to create misleading tracks.
- **Using Terrain**: The fleeing group may use terrain features to their advantage, such as crossing rivers, climbing cliffs, or navigating dense vegetation that might slow or stop pursuers.
- **Hiding**: The fleeing group may attempt to hide, using terrain features, darkness, or other concealment to break line of sight with pursuers.
- **Delaying Actions**: The fleeing group may take actions to delay pursuers, such as dropping caltrops, oil, or other obstacles, or setting simple traps.
- **Magical Assistance**: The fleeing group may use magic to aid their escape, such as spells that increase movement rate, create illusions, or render them invisible.

## Resolving Pursuit

The DM resolves pursuit using the following guidelines:

- **Simple Resolution**: For straightforward situations, the DM may resolve pursuit with a single check or comparison of movement rates, particularly if the outcome is clear or if detailed resolution would not add significantly to the game.
- **Detailed Resolution**: For more complex or significant situations, the DM may resolve pursuit in detail, tracking movement, applying modifiers for terrain and other factors, and allowing for specific tactics and countermeasures.
- **Player Agency**: The DM should allow players to make meaningful decisions during pursuit, such as choosing routes, employing tactics, or using resources, rather than reducing the situation to a single die roll.
- **NPC Decision-Making**: The DM should make decisions for NPCs and monsters based on their intelligence, nature, and motivations, creating realistic and consistent behavior.
- **Consequences**: The DM should consider the consequences of successful or failed pursuit, such as resource expenditure, time passage, or changes in the relationship between the groups.

## Conclusion

Pursuit adds a dynamic and exciting element to the AD&D game, creating tense situations where quick thinking, resource management, and knowledge of the environment can be as important as combat prowess. The DM should handle pursuit in a way that is fair, consistent, and reflective of the specific circumstances of each situation. By considering the factors that affect pursuit and allowing for creative tactics and meaningful decisions, the DM can create more engaging and realistic encounters that reward player skill and strategic thinking.
