# Saving Throws

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Overview

Saving throws represent a character's chance to avoid or reduce the effects of various dangers, hazards, and magical effects that cannot be dodged or parried like normal attacks. A successful saving throw might mean the character dodged a fireball, resisted a spell, avoided the full effect of a poison, or stayed on their feet against a dragon's breath weapon.

## The Five Categories of Saving Throws

In AD&D 1st Edition, saving throws are divided into five distinct categories:

### 1. Paralyzation, Poison, or Death Magic

This saving throw is used when a character faces:
- Paralysis attacks (ghoul touch, hold person spell)
- Poison (venomous bites, poisoned weapons, poison gas)
- Death magic (finger of death, symbol of death)
- Other instant-death effects

### 2. Rod, Staff, or Wand

This saving throw is used when a character is targeted by:
- Magical rods
- Magical staves
- Magical wands
- Similar magical devices that aren't specifically covered by other categories

### 3. Petrification or Polymorph

This saving throw is used against effects that transform the character's body:
- Petrification (medusa gaze, flesh to stone spell)
- Polymorph (polymorph other spell, wand of polymorphing)
- Transmutation effects
- Other form-altering magic

### 4. Breath Weapon

This saving throw is used against:
- Dragon breath weapons
- Hell hound breath
- Gas-breathing creatures
- Other breath-based attacks
- Certain area-effect spells that simulate breath weapons

### 5. Spell

This saving throw is used against:
- Most spells that allow saves
- Spell-like abilities
- Magical scrolls
- Innate magical abilities
- Other magical effects not covered by the other categories

## Saving Throw Tables

Saving throw values vary by character class and level. Lower numbers are better, as the player must roll equal to or higher than the listed value on a d20 to succeed.

- **Poison**: Typically reduced damage or effect on successful save

## Special Saving Throw Situations

### Saving Throws for Objects

Objects may need to make saving throws against certain effects:

| Material | Acid | Cold | Electricity | Fire | Force | Normal Blow |
|----------|------|------|------------|------|-------|-------------|
| Bone/Ivory | 10  | 18   | 16         | 10   | 8     | 10          |

### Saving Throws for Groups

When multiple characters or creatures are affected by the same effect:

1. Each individual makes their own saving throw
2. For large groups of similar creatures, the DM may roll once for the entire group
3. For very large groups, the DM may determine a percentage of successful saves

## Specific Saving Throw Applications

### Against Poison

- Successful save may reduce damage or negate effect entirely
- Constitution bonuses apply
- Slow-acting poisons may allow multiple saves
- Neutralize poison spell grants advantage on saves

### Against Petrification

- Successful save negates effect entirely
- Failed save results in complete petrification
- Stone to flesh spell can reverse the effect

### Against Breath Weapons

- Successful save results in half damage
- Cover may provide additional bonuses
- Evasion abilities may improve chances

### Against Spells

- Effects vary widely by spell
- Some spells allow no saving throw
- Spell resistance may apply before saving throws

## Improving Saving Throws

Characters can improve their saving throws through several means:

- **Gaining Levels**: All saving throws improve with level advancement
- **Magical Items**: Various items provide bonuses to saving throws
- **Spells**: Certain spells provide temporary bonuses
- **Class Abilities**: Some classes gain special saving throw bonuses
- **Racial Abilities**: Some races have innate saving throw bonuses

## Saving Throws vs. Other Mechanics

### Saving Throws vs. Armor Class

- Armor Class protects against physical attacks
- Saving throws protect against special attacks and magic
- Some effects bypass Armor Class entirely and require saving throws

### Saving Throws vs. Ability Checks

- Saving throws are for resisting harmful effects
- Ability checks are for accomplishing tasks
- In some cases, either mechanic might be appropriate

## DM Guidance on Saving Throws

### When to Call for Saving Throws

- When a spell or effect specifically calls for one
- When a character is subjected to a sudden danger
- When a character might avoid or resist a harmful effect
- When the rules specifically indicate a saving throw is needed

### Creating New Saving Throw Situations

When creating new effects that require saving throws:

1. Determine which category is most appropriate
2. Decide the consequences of success and failure
3. Apply appropriate modifiers
4. Be consistent in application

### Describing Saving Throw Results

Successful and failed saving throws should be described dramatically:

- **Success**: "You dive aside as the fireball explodes, the heat washing over you but not consuming you."
- **Failure**: "The basilisk's gaze locks with yours, and you feel your limbs stiffening as your flesh transforms to stone."
