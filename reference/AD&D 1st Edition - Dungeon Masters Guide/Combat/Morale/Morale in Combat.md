# Morale in Combat

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Morale in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game represents the willingness of non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters to continue fighting in the face of danger or adversity. This section provides detailed information on morale and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling morale checks during combat.

## Nature of Morale

Morale in the AD&D game has the following characteristics:

- **Psychological Factor**: Morale represents the psychological state of creatures in combat, including their courage, determination, and willingness to face danger.
- **Variable by Creature**: Different types of creatures have different base morale scores, reflecting their natural courage or cowardice, discipline, or ferocity.
- **Situational Influence**: Morale is influenced by various situational factors, including leadership, numerical advantage or disadvantage, and specific events during combat.
- **Non-Player Application**: Morale checks are typically applied only to NPCs and monsters, not to player characters, whose actions are determined by player decisions rather than dice rolls.
- **Tactical Significance**: Morale can have significant tactical implications, potentially causing enemies to flee, surrender, or fight with reduced effectiveness when their morale breaks.

## The Morale Score

Each type of NPC or monster has a morale score:

- **Score Range**: Morale scores typically range from 2 (very cowardly) to 12 (fearless), with an average score of 7.
- **Racial or Type Base**: Different races or types of creatures have different base morale scores. For example:
  - Goblins: 6-8
  - Orcs: 8
  - Hobgoblins: 9
  - Gnolls: 7-8
  - Bugbears: 9
  - Ogres: 10
  - Giants: 11
  - Undead: 12 (typically immune to morale checks)
- **Training and Discipline**: Well-trained or disciplined troops typically have higher morale scores than untrained or undisciplined ones.
- **Fanaticism**: Fanatics, whether religious zealots or creatures with extreme loyalty, typically have very high morale scores (11-12).
- **Mercenary Status**: Mercenaries typically have lower morale scores than troops fighting for their homeland or beliefs, unless they are elite mercenaries.

## When to Check Morale

Morale checks are made at specific points during combat:

- **First Casualty**: When a group suffers its first casualty (death or incapacitation), a morale check is typically made.
- **25% Casualties**: When a group has suffered casualties equal to 25% of its original number, a morale check is made.
- **50% Casualties**: When a group has suffered casualties equal to 50% of its original number, a morale check is made.
- **Leader Loss**: When a group's leader is killed, captured, or flees, a morale check is made.
- **Ally Retreat**: When allies or friendly forces retreat or surrender, a morale check may be made.
- **Unexpected Threat**: When a group faces an unexpected or particularly terrifying threat, such as a dragon suddenly appearing or a spell with dramatic effects, a morale check may be made.
- **After Retreat**: When a group that has retreated is rallied and ordered to return to combat, a morale check is made.

## Making Morale Checks

Morale checks are made using the following procedure:

- **Dice Roll**: The DM rolls 2d10 (two ten-sided dice) and compares the result to the creature's morale score.
- **Success or Failure**: If the roll is equal to or less than the morale score, the check succeeds, and the creatures continue fighting. If the roll is greater than the morale score, the check fails, and the creatures' morale breaks.
- **Group or Individual**: Morale checks can be made for groups of similar creatures or for individual significant NPCs, depending on the situation and the DM's preference.
- **Player Character Henchmen**: Henchmen of player characters may make morale checks, but their loyalty to their employer (based on Charisma and treatment) can provide bonuses to these checks.

## Morale Modifiers

Various factors can modify morale checks:

- **Leadership**: The presence of a strong leader can provide a bonus to morale checks, typically +1 or +2.
- **Numerical Advantage**: Having significantly more fighters than the opposition can provide a bonus to morale checks, typically +1 or +2.
- **Numerical Disadvantage**: Being significantly outnumbered can impose a penalty to morale checks, typically -1 or -2.
- **Superior Position**: Having a superior tactical position, such as higher ground or prepared defenses, can provide a bonus to morale checks, typically +1.
- **Recent Victory**: Having recently achieved a significant victory can provide a bonus to morale checks, typically +1.
- **Recent Defeat**: Having recently suffered a significant defeat can impose a penalty to morale checks, typically -1.
- **Surprise**: Being surprised at the beginning of an encounter can impose a penalty to initial morale checks, typically -1.
- **Supernatural Dread**: Facing creatures that inspire supernatural dread, such as dragons or powerful undead, can impose penalties to morale checks, typically -1 to -4 depending on the creature.

## Effects of Failed Morale

When a morale check fails, the affected creatures' morale breaks, resulting in one of the following behaviors:

- **Orderly Retreat**: Disciplined or intelligent creatures may conduct an orderly retreat, moving away from the enemy while maintaining formation and defensive posture.
- **Rout**: Less disciplined creatures may rout, fleeing in panic and abandoning equipment, allies, or objectives in their haste to escape.
- **Surrender**: Some creatures may surrender, particularly if retreat is impossible or if they believe mercy might be granted.
- **Fight Defensively**: Some creatures may continue fighting but adopt a defensive posture, focusing on self-preservation rather than achieving victory.
- **Berserk Frenzy**: Certain creatures, particularly those of a bestial or savage nature, may react to broken morale by entering a berserk frenzy, attacking with reckless abandon.

## Rallying Broken Morale

Creatures whose morale has broken may be rallied under certain circumstances:

- **Leadership**: A strong leader may be able to rally troops whose morale has broken by making an inspiring speech, threatening punishment, or demonstrating personal courage.
- **Safe Position**: Retreating to a safe position, such as a prepared defensive line or reinforcements, may allow for rallying.
- **Time Passage**: After a certain amount of time has passed, typically several turns, creatures may recover their composure and be ready to re-enter combat.
- **Significant Advantage**: If the situation changes significantly in favor of the creatures whose morale has broken, such as the arrival of reinforcements or the enemy suffering major casualties, they may rally.
- **Rally Check**: To determine if creatures rally, the DM may make another morale check, potentially with modifiers based on the specific circumstances.

## Creatures Immune to Morale

Certain creatures are immune to morale checks:

- **Undead**: Most undead creatures, lacking fear or self-preservation instincts, are immune to morale checks.
- **Constructs**: Golems and other constructs, operating according to their programming rather than emotions, are typically immune to morale checks.
- **Mindless Creatures**: Creatures without minds, such as oozes or mindless vermin, are immune to morale checks.
- **Fanatics**: Creatures with absolute devotion to a cause or leader may be immune to certain morale checks, particularly those triggered by casualties.
- **Magically Controlled**: Creatures under magical control, such as those affected by a charm person spell, typically follow the commands of their controller regardless of morale considerations.

## Morale and Player Characters

Player characters are generally not subject to morale checks:

- **Player Agency**: The actions of player characters are determined by player decisions rather than dice rolls, reflecting the agency that players have over their characters.
- **Role-Playing Consideration**: Players should consider their characters' courage, personality, and the situation when deciding whether to continue fighting, retreat, or surrender, rather than relying on mechanical morale checks.
- **Magical Fear Effects**: Player characters are still subject to magical fear effects, such as a dragon's fear aura or a cause fear spell, which typically allow saving throws to resist.
- **Henchmen and Followers**: NPCs who serve player characters, such as henchmen, followers, or hired guards, are subject to morale checks, though their loyalty to the characters may provide bonuses.

## Conclusion

Morale is a crucial element of combat in the AD&D game, adding a layer of realism and unpredictability to encounters. The DM should use the morale system to create more dynamic and believable combat situations, where enemies may flee, surrender, or fight to the death depending on their nature and the circumstances. By considering the factors that affect morale and applying morale checks at appropriate moments, the DM can create more engaging and varied combat encounters that go beyond simple fights to the death.
