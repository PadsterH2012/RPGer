*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide (Pages 61-83)*

## Overview

Combat is a central element of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, representing the conflicts between player characters and the various monsters and adversaries they encounter during their adventures. The AD&D combat system is designed to balance realism with playability, providing a framework for resolving combat situations without bogging down the game with excessive detail.

The combat rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide cover a wide range of situations, from basic melee encounters to complex aerial battles. They provide guidelines for initiative, movement, attacks, damage, and special combat maneuvers.

## Combat Structure

Combat in AD&D is divided into rounds, each representing approximately one minute of game time. During a round, characters and monsters take actions according to initiative order, with various factors affecting the timing and outcome of these actions.

The basic structure of combat includes:

1. **Surprise determination** - Determining if either side is caught unprepared
2. **Distance determination** - Establishing how far apart the combatants are
3. **Initiative determination** - Rolling to see who acts first
4. **Actions** - Resolving the actions of all participants
5. **Continuation** - Repeating steps 3-4 until combat ends

## Combat Philosophy

The AD&D combat system emphasizes heroic fantasy over gritty realism. As stated in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

"It would be no great task to devise an elaborate set of rules for highly complex individual combats with rounds of but a few seconds length. It is not in the best interests of an adventure game, however, to delve too deeply into cut and thrust, parry and riposte. The location of a hit or wound, the sort of damage done, sprains, breaks, and dislocations are not the stuff of heroic fantasy."

This philosophy guides the design of the combat rules, focusing on dramatic action rather than detailed simulation.
