# Melee Weapons

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Melee weapons in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are weapons designed for close combat, used to strike opponents within arm's reach or slightly beyond. This section provides detailed information on melee weapons and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in combat.

## Types of Melee Weapons

There are several categories of melee weapons in the AD&D game:

- **Swords**: Bladed weapons of various lengths and designs, including short swords, long swords, two-handed swords, bastard swords, broad swords, and scimitars.
- **Axes**: Weapons with a metal blade attached to a handle, including hand axes, battle axes, and great axes.
- **Blunt Weapons**: Weapons designed to crush rather than cut, including clubs, maces, hammers, flails, and staves.
- **Polearms**: Long-hafted weapons with various head designs, including spears, halberds, pikes, glaives, and many others.
- **Daggers and Knives**: Short bladed weapons designed for stabbing or cutting, including daggers, dirks, and punching daggers.
- **Miscellaneous Weapons**: Various other melee weapons that don't fit neatly into the above categories, such as whips, nets, and lances.

## Weapon Characteristics

Each melee weapon has several characteristics that define its performance in combat:

- **Damage**: The amount of damage the weapon inflicts on a successful hit, typically expressed as a die roll (e.g., 1d8 for a long sword).
- **Speed Factor**: How quickly the weapon can be used, affecting initiative in combat. Lower numbers represent faster weapons.
- **Space Required**: How much space is needed to use the weapon effectively, affecting its usability in confined areas.
- **Length**: The reach of the weapon, affecting which opponents can be attacked and the order of attacks in certain situations.
- **Weight**: The weight of the weapon, affecting encumbrance and who can use it effectively.
- **Type**: Whether the weapon inflicts slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage, which can affect its effectiveness against different types of armor and creatures.

## Weapon vs. Armor Type Adjustments

In the AD&D game, the effectiveness of different types of weapons varies depending on the type of armor the target is wearing. This is represented by the Weapon vs. Armor Type table, which provides adjustments to the attack roll based on the combination of weapon and armor.

For example:

- **Bludgeoning Weapons**: Generally more effective against rigid armors like plate mail, as they can transmit force through the armor to cause injury.
- **Slashing Weapons**: Generally more effective against lighter, flexible armors, as they can cut through or between the protective elements.
- **Piercing Weapons**: Generally effective against most types of armor, as they can penetrate between links of chain mail or find gaps in plate armor.

## Weapon Proficiency

A character's proficiency with a weapon affects their ability to use it effectively:

- **Proficient**: Characters who are proficient with a weapon use it without penalty.
- **Non-Proficient**: Characters who are not proficient with a weapon suffer a penalty to their attack rolls when using it. The specific penalty depends on the character's class:
  - Fighters, Paladins, Rangers: -2 to hit
  - Clerics, Druids, Thieves, Assassins, Bards: -3 to hit
  - Magic-Users, Illusionists: -5 to hit
- **Weapon Proficiency Slots**: Characters have a limited number of weapon proficiency slots, determined by their class and level, which they can use to become proficient with specific weapons.
- **Specialization**: As an optional rule, fighters may specialize in a specific weapon, gaining bonuses to hit and damage with that weapon but using multiple proficiency slots.

## Special Melee Combat Situations

Various special situations can arise in melee combat:

- **Two-Weapon Fighting**: Characters can fight with a weapon in each hand, gaining an extra attack but suffering penalties to hit unless they have special abilities.
- **Weapon Breakage**: Weapons can break in certain circumstances, such as when a natural 1 is rolled on an attack roll (if using the critical fumble optional rule) or when used against certain creatures or objects.
- **Disarming**: Characters can attempt to disarm opponents rather than damage them, typically requiring a successful attack roll with specific penalties and potentially allowing the target a saving throw to retain their weapon.
- **Sundering**: Characters can attempt to damage or destroy an opponent's weapon or shield, typically requiring a successful attack roll against a specific Armor Class and dealing damage to the item rather than the opponent.
- **Improvised Weapons**: Characters can use improvised weapons, such as chairs, bottles, or other objects not designed as weapons, typically with penalties to hit and reduced damage compared to proper weapons.

## Magical Melee Weapons

Magical melee weapons provide various benefits beyond their normal characteristics:

- **Attack and Damage Bonuses**: Magical weapons typically provide bonuses to attack rolls and damage rolls, expressed as a plus (e.g., a long sword +1 provides a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls).
- **Special Properties**: Some magical weapons have special properties beyond simple bonuses, such as the ability to harm creatures that are immune to normal weapons, to cause additional damage to specific types of creatures, or to provide special abilities to the wielder.
- **Intelligence and Alignment**: Some magical weapons have intelligence and alignment, with their own personalities, goals, and abilities. These weapons may communicate with their wielders and may have specific requirements or restrictions on who can use them.
- **Cursed Weapons**: Some magical weapons are cursed, providing penalties rather than bonuses or having other negative effects. Once wielded, cursed weapons typically cannot be discarded without the use of specific spells or procedures.

## Class Restrictions on Melee Weapons

Different character classes have different restrictions on the types of melee weapons they can use:

- **Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers**: Can use any melee weapon.
- **Clerics**: Are restricted to blunt weapons (no edged or pointed weapons).
- **Druids**: Are restricted to certain weapons (club, dagger, dart, hammer, scimitar, spear, staff).
- **Magic-Users and Illusionists**: Are restricted to daggers and staves.
- **Thieves**: Can use certain weapons (club, dagger, dart, sling, short sword).
- **Assassins**: Can use any melee weapon.
- **Monks**: Can use certain weapons (club, dagger, hand axe, javelin, pole arm, spear, staff).
- **Bards**: Can use any melee weapon.

## Conclusion

Melee weapons are a fundamental aspect of combat in the AD&D game, providing characters with the means to engage in close combat with opponents. The DM should use these guidelines to handle melee weapons in a way that is realistic and consistent, while also considering the specific needs and themes of the campaign. By understanding the characteristics and rules for different types of melee weapons, the DM can create more dynamic and engaging combat encounters that reward player skill and tactical thinking.
