# Armor Class

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Overview

Armor Class (AC) is a measure of how difficult it is to hit and damage a character or creature in combat. It represents a combination of physical protection from armor, natural toughness, agility, magical protection, and other defensive factors. The lower the Armor Class number, the better protected the character or creature is.

## The Armor Class Scale

In AD&D 1st Edition, Armor Class is measured on a descending scale:

- **AC 10**: No armor, no shield, no Dexterity bonus (base human)
- **AC 9-8**: Light protection (leather armor, high Dexterity)
- **AC 7-6**: Moderate protection (studded leather, ring mail)
- **AC 5-4**: Heavy protection (chain mail, scale mail)
- **AC 3-2**: Very heavy protection (plate mail, banded mail)
- **AC 1-0**: Exceptional protection (field plate, full plate)
- **AC -1 to -10**: Extraordinary protection (magical armor, powerful creatures)

Lower numbers (including negative numbers) represent better protection and are harder to hit.

## Natural Armor Class

Many creatures have natural armor that provides protection without worn armor:

- **Thick Hide/Scales**: Many monsters have naturally tough skin
- **Magical Nature**: Some creatures have innate magical protection
- **Size**: Very large creatures may be harder to damage effectively
- **Undead/Constructs**: May be naturally resistant to physical damage

Examples of natural Armor Classes:

| Creature | Natural AC | Reason |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Dragon | -1 to -5 | Scales, size, magical nature |
| Giant | 4 to 0 | Thick hide, size |
| Troll | 4 | Regenerative hide |
| Stone Golem | 5 | Stone construction |
| Iron Golem | 3 | Iron construction |
| Skeleton | 7 | Bone structure |
| Gelatinous Cube | 8 | Amorphous body |

## Special Armor Class Rules

### Armor Class and Saving Throws

Armor Class generally does not affect saving throws, with these exceptions:

- Breath weapons: Dexterity bonus to AC may apply to saves (DM's option)
- Certain magical effects: Specific magical protections may apply to both AC and saves

### Armor Class and Non-Combat Damage

Armor Class may not protect against certain types of damage:

- **Falling damage**: AC provides no protection
- **Fire/Cold damage**: AC provides limited or no protection
- **Poison/Disease**: AC provides no protection
- **Mental attacks**: AC provides no protection

### Armor Class and Touch Attacks

Some attacks only require touching the target and ignore armor bonuses:

- **Touch spells**: Use base AC 10, modified only by Dexterity and magical protection not from physical armor
- **Certain monster attacks**: Some special attacks ignore armor

## Armor Class and Movement

Heavier armor restricts movement:

| Armor Type | Base Movement Rate |
|------------|-------------------|
| No Armor | 12" |
| Leather, Padded | 12" |
| Studded Leather, Ring Mail | 9" |
| Scale Mail | 6" |
| Chain Mail | 9" |
| Splint Mail, Banded Mail | 6" |
| Plate Mail | 6" |
| Field Plate | 6" |
| Full Plate | 6" |

## Armor Class and Class Restrictions

Different character classes have restrictions on the armor they can wear:

- **Fighters, Paladins, Rangers**: Can wear any armor
- **Clerics**: Can wear any armor
- **Druids**: Limited to leather, padded, or hide armor
- **Thieves**: Limited to leather armor, suffer skill penalties in heavier armor
- **Assassins**: Limited to leather armor, suffer skill penalties in heavier armor
- **Magic-Users**: Cannot wear any armor (except elven chain in some cases)
- **Illusionists**: Cannot wear any armor
- **Monks**: Cannot wear any armor, but gain improved AC as they advance in level

## Calculating Final Armor Class

To determine a character's final Armor Class:

1. Start with the base AC from armor worn
2. Apply shield bonus if using a shield
3. Apply Dexterity modifier
4. Apply magical bonuses from armor and shield
5. Apply magical bonuses from other items (rings, cloaks, etc.)
6. Apply any situational modifiers

### Example Calculations

**Fighter in Plate Mail with Shield:**
- Base AC from plate mail: 3
- Shield bonus: -1
- Dexterity 16 modifier: -2
- Final AC: 0

**Thief in Leather Armor:**
- Base AC from leather: 8
- No shield
- Dexterity 17 modifier: -3
- Final AC: 5

**Magic-User with Ring of Protection:**
- Base AC (no armor): 10
- No shield
- Dexterity 15 modifier: -1
- Ring of Protection +2: -2
- Final AC: 7

**Monk (8th level):**
- Base AC from monk abilities: 4
- No armor or shield
- Dexterity 18 modifier: -4
- Final AC: 0

## Armor Class in Special Environments

### Underwater Combat

- Leather and padded armor function normally
- Metal armors impose severe movement penalties
- Natural swimmers ignore AC penalties

### Aerial Combat

- No special AC modifications
- Very heavy armor may cause falling if magical flight fails

### Desert/Hot Climate

- Heavy armor imposes Constitution checks to avoid exhaustion
- May impose combat penalties due to fatigue

### Arctic/Cold Climate

- Metal armor becomes extremely cold, may cause damage
- Padded armor provides better protection

## Improving Armor Class

Characters can improve their Armor Class through several means:

- **Better Armor**: Acquiring higher quality or magical armor
- **Magical Items**: Finding or creating protective magical items
- **Spells**: Casting or having protective spells cast upon them
- **Training**: Monks improve AC as they gain levels
- **Dexterity Improvement**: Magical means of increasing Dexterity
- **Tactical Positioning**: Using cover, concealment, and terrain

## Armor Class and Combat Tables

Attack rolls are resolved by comparing the attacker's THAC0 (To Hit Armor Class 0) to the defender's AC:

1. Start with attacker's THAC0
2. Subtract defender's AC
3. Result is the number needed on d20 to hit

For the complete combat tables showing the relationship between attacker level, THAC0, and target AC, see the [Combat Tables](../Tables/Combat_Tables.md) document.
