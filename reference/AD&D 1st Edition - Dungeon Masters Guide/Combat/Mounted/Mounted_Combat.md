# Mounted Combat

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Overview

Mounted combat provides significant advantages in mobility, height, and striking power, but also presents unique challenges and vulnerabilities. These rules govern how characters and creatures fight while mounted on horses, magical beasts, or other riding animals.

## Mounting and Dismounting

### Basic Rules

- **Mounting**: Requires 1 segment (1/10 of a round) with a stationary, willing mount
- **Mounting (Unwilling/Moving Mount)**: Requires a Dexterity check with a -4 penalty
- **Dismounting**: Requires 1 segment under normal circumstances
- **Emergency Dismount**: Can be performed instantly but requires a Dexterity check to avoid falling prone

### Special Situations

- **Mounting from Difficult Positions**: Mounting from uneven terrain, in cramped quarters, or during combat imposes penalties from -1 to -4 on the Dexterity check
- **Assisted Mounting**: Another character can assist, providing a +2 bonus to the Dexterity check
- **Trained War Mounts**: Reduce mounting difficulty by 2 points due to their training

## Movement While Mounted

### Movement Rates

| Mount Type | Walk | Trot | Canter | Gallop |
|------------|------|------|--------|--------|
| Light Horse | 12" | 24" | 36" | 48" |
| Medium Horse | 10" | 20" | 30" | 40" |
| Heavy Horse | 8" | 16" | 24" | 32" |
| Pony | 9" | 18" | 27" | 36" |
| Mule | 6" | 12" | 18" | 24" |
| Camel | 7" | 14" | 21" | 28" |
| Elephant | 6" | 12" | - | - |
| Other Mounts | As specified in monster description |

### Endurance and Fatigue

- **Walk**: Can be maintained indefinitely without tiring the mount
- **Trot**: Can be maintained for hours equal to the mount's Constitution/2
- **Canter**: Can be maintained for turns equal to the mount's Constitution
- **Gallop**: Can be maintained for rounds equal to the mount's Constitution
- **Fatigue Effects**: Fatigued mounts move at half speed and suffer a -2 penalty to all rolls

### Terrain Effects

- **Clear Terrain**: No movement penalties
- **Light Woods**: Movement reduced by 1/3, no galloping allowed
- **Heavy Woods**: Mounted movement impossible except on trails
- **Broken Ground**: Movement reduced by 1/2, no cantering or galloping
- **Steep Slopes**: Movement reduced by 2/3, no galloping
- **Swamp/Bog**: Movement reduced by 2/3, risk of mount becoming stuck

## Combat While Mounted

### Attack Bonuses

- **Height Advantage**: +1 to hit against unmounted opponents of human size or smaller
- **Charging**: +2 to hit when charging with a lance or spear
- **Weapon Specialization**: Applies normally while mounted

### Attack Penalties

- **Untrained Rider**: -2 to all attack rolls while mounted
- **Untrained Mount**: -1 to all attack rolls due to mount's unpredictable movements
- **Firing Missiles**: -2 penalty when firing missile weapons from a moving mount (except for horse archers)
- **Casting Spells**: -2 to saving throws for spell failure when casting from a moving mount

### Damage Bonuses

- **Charging with Lance**: Double damage on a successful hit
- **Charging with Spear**: +2 damage on a successful hit

| Lance | Excellent | Designed for mounted combat |
| Spear | Excellent | Well-suited for mounted combat |
| Long Sword | Good | Effective from horseback |
| Mace/Flail | Good | Effective from horseback |
| Battle Axe | Good | Effective from horseback |
| Two-Handed Sword | Poor | -2 to hit when used from horseback |

## Lance Charges

### Basic Rules

- Lance charges require at least 20' of straight movement before impact
- Full charge (with 60'+ of movement) deals double damage
- Lance is typically dropped or becomes unusable after initial impact
- A character can only use a lance effectively if proficient with it

### Lance Charge Results

- **Hit on Opponent**: Normal damage (or double damage on full charge)
- **Critical Hit**: Lance does maximum damage plus rider's Strength bonus
- **Miss**: Rider must make a Dexterity check or drop the lance
- **Opponent Set to Receive Charge**: Opponent deals double damage if they hit first

### Special Lance Charge Situations

- **Charging Unmounted Opponent**: +2 to hit, double damage on full charge
- **Charging Mounted Opponent**: Normal to hit, both riders roll for damage
- **Unhorsing**: On a natural 20, opponent must save vs. paralyzation or be unhorsed

## Mounted Missile Combat

### Basic Rules

- Firing missiles from a moving mount imposes a -2 penalty to hit
- Horse archers (with proficiency) suffer no penalty
- Crossbows impose an additional -1 penalty due to their unwieldiness
- Thrown weapons suffer only a -1 penalty

### Special Considerations

- **Mount Movement**: Penalties increase by 1 for each movement rate above a trot
- **Target Movement**: Normal penalties for firing at moving targets still apply
- **Firing Arc**: Mounted archers can only fire in a 180Â° arc to their front and side
- **Firing Behind**: Requires a Dexterity check and imposes an additional -2 penalty

## Mounted Spellcasting

### Basic Rules

- Casting while mounted on a stationary mount is normal
- Casting while mounted on a walking mount requires a concentration check (Intelligence -2)
- Casting while mounted on a trotting mount requires a concentration check (Intelligence -4)
- Casting while mounted on a cantering or galloping mount is impossible

### Spell Components

- Somatic components can be performed normally while mounted
- Material components require a free hand, making two-handed weapon use impossible
- Verbal components can be performed normally

## Mounted Combat Tactics

### Cavalry Tactics

- **Charge and Withdraw**: Charge with lance, then withdraw to safe distance
- **Harassing Fire**: Circle opponents while firing missile weapons
- **Flanking**: Use superior mobility to attack from unexpected directions
- **Formation Riding**: Trained cavalry can perform coordinated maneuvers

### Countering Mounted Opponents

- **Set Spears/Polearms**: Ready action to set weapon against charge for double damage
- **Target the Mount**: Attacking the mount may be easier than the rider
- **Difficult Terrain**: Force mounted opponents into terrain that hinders movement
- **Dismounting Tactics**: Attempt to pull riders from their mounts

## Mount Reactions in Combat

### Untrained Mounts

- Must make morale check when first entering combat
- Must make morale check when taking damage
- Must make morale check when encountering frightening creatures/situations
- Require one hand for control at all times

### Mount Attacks

- Magical barding is extremely rare
- Barding must be specifically fitted to mount type and size
