# Character Age

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

The age of a character in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is an important characteristic that affects the character's abilities and role in the game. This section provides guidelines for determining and tracking character age.

## Starting Age

When a character is created, their starting age is determined based on their race and class. The following guidelines apply:

### Base Age

Each race has a base age, which represents the age at which a member of that race typically reaches physical maturity:

- **Human**: 18 years
- **Dwarf**: 40 years
- **Elf**: 110 years
- **Gnome**: 60 years
- **Half-Elf**: 22 years
- **Halfling**: 20 years
- **Half-Orc**: 15 years

### Class Modifier

Each class has a modifier that is added to the base age to determine the character's starting age. This modifier represents the additional years of training or study required to become proficient in the class:

- **Fighter**: 1d4 years
- **Ranger**: 1d8 years
- **Paladin**: 1d4 years
- **Cleric**: 2d4 years
- **Druid**: 2d6 years
- **Magic-User**: 2d8 years
- **Illusionist**: 1d12 years
- **Thief**: 1d4 years
- **Assassin**: 2d6 years
- **Monk**: 2d6 years
- **Bard**: 1d8 years

### Multi-Class Characters

For multi-class characters, use the highest class modifier among the character's classes.

## Age Categories

Characters progress through several age categories during their lives, with each category having different effects on the character's abilities:

- **Youth**: From birth to the base age for the character's race. Characters in this category are not typically playable as adventurers.
- **Young Adult**: From the base age to the onset of middle age. This is the prime of life for most characters, with no age-related modifiers to abilities.
- **Middle Age**: The specific age range varies by race, but this category typically begins at about 1/3 of the maximum age for the race. Characters in this category experience a slight decrease in physical abilities and a slight increase in mental abilities.
- **Old Age**: The specific age range varies by race, but this category typically begins at about 2/3 of the maximum age for the race. Characters in this category experience a moderate decrease in physical abilities and a moderate increase in mental abilities.
- **Vunerable**: The specific age range varies by race, but this category typically begins at about 9/10 of the maximum age for the race. Characters in this category experience a significant decrease in physical abilities and a significant increase in mental abilities.

## Maximum Age

Each race has a maximum age, beyond which the character cannot survive without magical intervention:

- **Human**: 90+2d20 years
- **Dwarf**: 250+3d100 years
- **Elf**: 350+4d100 years
- **Gnome**: 200+3d100 years
- **Half-Elf**: 125+3d20 years
- **Halfling**: 100+5d20 years
- **Half-Orc**: 60+d10 years

When a character reaches their maximum age, they die of old age.

## Tracking Age

The DM is responsible for tracking the passage of time in the campaign and for updating character ages accordingly. The following guidelines apply:

- **Campaign Time**: The DM should keep track of the passage of days, weeks, months, and years in the campaign.
- **Character Age**: The DM should update character ages based on the passage of campaign time.
- **Age Effects**: The DM should apply the appropriate age-related modifiers to character abilities as characters progress through the age categories.

## Conclusion

Character age is an important characteristic that affects the character's abilities and role in the game. The DM should use these rules as guidelines, adapting them as necessary to suit the specific needs and preferences of their campaign.
