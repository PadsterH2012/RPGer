# Aging

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Aging is a natural process that affects all characters in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. As characters age, they experience changes in their abilities, typically with physical abilities decreasing and mental abilities increasing. This section provides guidelines for handling the effects of aging in the game.

## Natural Aging

Natural aging occurs as characters progress through the age categories described in the "Character Age" section. The following effects apply as characters age:

### Middle Age

When a character reaches middle age, the following changes occur:

- **Strength**: -1
- **Dexterity**: -1
- **Constitution**: -1
- **Intelligence**: +1
- **Wisdom**: +1

### Old Age

When a character reaches old age, the following additional changes occur:

- **Strength**: -2 (total -3 from young adult)
- **Dexterity**: -2 (total -3 from young adult)
- **Constitution**: -2 (total -3 from young adult)
- **Intelligence**: +1 (total +2 from young adult)
- **Wisdom**: +1 (total +2 from young adult)

### Venerable Age

When a character reaches venerable age, the following additional changes occur:

- **Strength**: -1 (total -4 from young adult)
- **Dexterity**: -1 (total -4 from young adult)
- **Constitution**: -1 (total -4 from young adult)
- **Intelligence**: +1 (total +3 from young adult)
- **Wisdom**: +1 (total +3 from young adult)

## Unnatural Aging

In addition to natural aging, characters may experience unnatural aging due to magical effects, such as certain spells or magical items. Unnatural aging can cause a character to advance through the age categories more quickly than normal, with all the associated effects on abilities.

### Magical Aging

Several magical effects can cause a character to age unnaturally:

- **Haste Spell**: Each use of the haste spell ages the recipient by 1 year.
- **Wish Spell**: Each use of the wish spell ages the caster by 3 years.
- **Limited Wish Spell**: Each use of the limited wish spell ages the caster by 1 year.
- **Ghost Special Attack**: A successful aging attack by a ghost ages the victim by 10-40 (1d4 Ã— 10) years.
- **Certain Magical Items**: Some magical items, such as a potion of longevity or a staff of withering, can cause aging or reverse aging.

### Effects of Unnatural Aging

Unnatural aging has the same effects on a character's abilities as natural aging. If unnatural aging causes a character to advance to a new age category, the character immediately experiences the ability score changes associated with that category.

### Reversing Unnatural Aging

Certain magical effects can reverse unnatural aging:

- **Potion of Longevity**: This potion reduces the drinker's age by 1-12 (1d12) years. However, there is a 10% cumulative chance that each additional potion will have the opposite effect, aging the drinker by 1-12 years instead.
- **Wish Spell**: A carefully worded wish spell can reverse aging, typically by 1-10 (1d10) years.

## System Shock Rolls for Aging

When a character experiences significant aging in a short period (such as from a ghost's aging attack), the DM may require a system shock roll to determine if the character survives the shock to their system. The character must roll their Constitution percentage or less on percentile dice to survive.

## Conclusion

Aging is an important aspect of character development in the AD&D game. The DM should track character ages and apply the appropriate effects as characters progress through the age categories. Unnatural aging can add an element of risk to certain magical effects and can create interesting challenges for characters to overcome.
