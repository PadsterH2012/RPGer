# Character Age, Aging, Disease, and Death

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

The passage of time affects characters in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game in various ways. Characters age, they may contract diseases, and eventually, they die. This section provides guidelines for handling these aspects of the game.

## Overview

The life cycle of a character in the AD&D game mirrors the life cycle of a real person, albeit with fantasy elements. Characters are born, they grow to maturity, they age, they may become ill, and eventually they die. The specific details of this life cycle vary by race, with some races (such as elves) living much longer than others (such as humans).

The DM is responsible for tracking the passage of time in the campaign and for applying the effects of aging, disease, and death to characters. These elements can add realism and drama to the game, but they should be handled with care to ensure that they enhance the game experience rather than detracting from it.

## Character Age

The age of a character affects their abilities and their role in the game. Young characters may be inexperienced but physically vigorous, while older characters may be wise but physically diminished. The specific effects of age vary by race and are detailed in the "Character Age" section.

## Aging

As characters age, they experience changes in their abilities. Typically, physical abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) decrease with age, while mental abilities (Intelligence, Wisdom) increase with age. The specific effects of aging vary by race and are detailed in the "Aging" section.

In addition to natural aging, characters may experience unnatural aging due to magical effects, such as certain spells or magical items. The effects of unnatural aging are detailed in the "Unnatural Aging" subsection.

## Disease

Characters may contract diseases during their adventures. Diseases can range from minor ailments to life-threatening conditions, and they can affect characters in various ways, from temporary ability score reductions to permanent disability or death. The specific effects of diseases and the methods for treating them are detailed in the "Disease" section.

## Death

Death is a constant threat in the dangerous world of the AD&D game. Characters can die from combat, traps, poison, disease, old age, and various other causes. The specific rules for death and the possibilities for resurrection or other forms of return from death are detailed in the "Death" section.

## Conclusion

The handling of character age, aging, disease, and death is an important aspect of the AD&D game. These elements can add realism and drama to the game, but they should be handled with care to ensure that they enhance the game experience rather than detracting from it. The DM should use these rules as guidelines, adapting them as necessary to suit the specific needs and preferences of their campaign.
