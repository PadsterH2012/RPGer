## Types of Diseases

There are many types of diseases that can affect characters in the AD&D game. The following are examples of common diseases:

Parasitic infestations include diseases caused by parasites such as lice, fleas, ticks, and intestinal worms. These diseases are typically contracted through contact with infected individuals, animals, or environments.

- **Effects**: Parasitic infestations typically cause discomfort, weakness, and possibly ability score reductions. For example, an intestinal parasite might cause a -1 penalty to Strength and Constitution until treated.
- **Treatment**: Parasitic infestations can often be treated with herbal remedies, magical healing, or specific spells such as cure disease.

### Bacterial Infections

Bacterial infections include diseases such as plague, cholera, and various forms of fever. These diseases are typically contracted through contact with infected individuals, contaminated food or water, or disease-carrying vermin.

- **Effects**: Bacterial infections can cause fever, weakness, ability score reductions, and possibly death if untreated. For example, plague might cause a -2 penalty to all ability scores and require a save vs. death each day until treated.
- **Treatment**: Bacterial infections can often be treated with rest, herbal remedies, magical healing, or specific spells such as cure disease.

### Viral Infections

Viral infections include diseases such as smallpox, rabies, and various forms of fever. These diseases are typically contracted through contact with infected individuals or animals.

- **Effects**: Viral infections can cause fever, weakness, ability score reductions, and possibly death if untreated. For example, rabies might cause a -2 penalty to Wisdom and Charisma, with a progressive worsening of symptoms leading to death if untreated.
- **Treatment**: Viral infections can often be treated with rest, herbal remedies, magical healing, or specific spells such as cure disease.

### Fungal Infections

Fungal infections include diseases such as ringworm, athlete's foot, and various forms of rot. These diseases are typically contracted through contact with infected individuals, animals, or environments.

- **Effects**: Fungal infections typically cause discomfort, disfigurement, and possibly ability score reductions. For example, a fungal infection of the skin might cause a -1 penalty to Charisma until treated.
- **Treatment**: Fungal infections can often be treated with herbal remedies, magical healing, or specific spells such as cure disease.

### Magical Diseases

Magical diseases are caused by magical effects, such as curses, magical creatures, or magical environments. These diseases often have unusual or severe effects and may be resistant to normal treatment.

- **Effects**: Magical diseases can have a wide range of effects, from minor inconvenience to death. For example, a curse might cause a progressive wasting disease that reduces all ability scores by 1 per day until treated.
- **Treatment**: Magical diseases often require specific magical treatments, such as remove curse, specific magical items, or the intervention of powerful beings.

## Contracting Diseases

Characters may contract diseases in various ways:

- **Contact with Infected Individuals**: Characters who come into close contact with infected individuals may contract their diseases.
- **Contaminated Food or Water**: Characters who consume contaminated food or water may contract diseases.
- **Disease-Carrying Vermin**: Characters who are bitten by disease-carrying vermin, such as rats or mosquitoes, may contract diseases.
- **Unhealthy Environments**: Characters who spend time in unhealthy environments, such as swamps or sewers, may contract diseases.
- **Magical Effects**: Characters who are affected by certain magical effects, such as curses or the attacks of certain creatures, may contract diseases.

When a character is exposed to a disease, the DM may require a saving throw to determine if the character contracts the disease. The specific saving throw and modifiers depend on the nature of the disease and the circumstances of exposure.

## Treating Diseases

Diseases can be treated in various ways:

- **Rest and Care**: Many diseases can be overcome with rest and basic care, though this may take time and the character may suffer effects while recovering.
- **Herbal Remedies**: Certain herbs and natural substances can help to treat diseases. Characters with knowledge of herbalism may be able to prepare effective remedies.
- **Magical Healing**: Certain spells, such as cure disease, can instantly cure most diseases. Clerics and other spellcasters with access to these spells are highly valued for their ability to treat diseases.
- **Magical Items**: Certain magical items, such as a periapt of health, can protect against or cure diseases.
- **Divine Intervention**: In severe cases, characters may seek the intervention of deities or other powerful beings to cure diseases.

## Conclusion

Disease is a significant threat in the AD&D game, adding an element of realism and challenge to the fantasy world. The DM should use diseases as a tool to create interesting challenges and role-playing opportunities, rather than as a punitive measure. The specific effects and treatments of diseases should be tailored to the needs and preferences of the campaign.
