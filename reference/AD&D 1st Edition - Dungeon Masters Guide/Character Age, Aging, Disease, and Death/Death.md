# Death

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Death is a constant threat in the dangerous world of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. Characters can die from combat, traps, poison, disease, old age, and various other causes. This section provides guidelines for handling death and the possibilities for resurrection or other forms of return from death.

## Causes of Death

Characters can die from various causes in the AD&D game:

- **Combat**: Characters who are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points in combat are typically killed, though the DM may allow for the possibility of unconsciousness and recovery in certain circumstances.
- **Traps**: Certain traps can cause instant death, either through massive damage or through specific death effects.
- **Poison**: Certain poisons can cause death if the character fails a saving throw.
- **Disease**: Certain diseases can cause death if not treated in time.
- **Old Age**: Characters who reach their maximum age die of old age.
- **Magical Effects**: Certain magical effects, such as the death spell or the finger of death spell, can cause instant death.
- **System Shock**: Characters who experience certain traumatic events, such as polymorph or resurrection, must make a system shock roll or die.

## Death and Dying

When a character is reduced to 0 hit points, they are typically unconscious and dying. When a character is reduced to -10 hit points, they are dead. The following rules apply:

- **0 Hit Points**: A character with exactly 0 hit points is unconscious and will die in the next round unless they receive healing.
- **-1 to -9 Hit Points**: A character with negative hit points is unconscious and dying. They will lose 1 hit point per round until they either receive healing or reach -10 hit points.
- **-10 Hit Points**: A character with -10 hit points is dead.

## Resurrection and Return from Death

Death is not necessarily permanent in the AD&D game. There are several ways for characters to return from death:

### Raise Dead Spell

The raise dead spell can return a dead character to life, subject to the following limitations:

- The character must have been dead for no more than one day per level of the caster.
- The character's body must be relatively intact.
- The character must make a successful resurrection survival roll based on their Constitution score.
- The character will be weak and helpless for a period of time after being raised.
- The character will permanently lose 1 point of Constitution.

### Resurrection Spell

The resurrection spell is a more powerful version of raise dead, with the following differences:

- The character can have been dead for any length of time.
- The character's body need not be intact; a small portion of the body (such as a finger) is sufficient.
- The character will still be weak and helpless for a period of time after being resurrected.
- The character will still permanently lose 1 point of Constitution.

### Reincarnation Spell

The reincarnation spell returns a dead character to life in a new body, subject to the following limitations:

- The character must have been dead for no more than one week.
- The character's new body is determined randomly and may be of a different race or even a different species.
- The character retains their memories, personality, and mental abilities, but their physical abilities are those of their new body.
- The character does not lose a point of Constitution.

### Wish Spell

A wish spell can return a dead character to life, potentially without the limitations of the raise dead, resurrection, or reincarnation spells. However, the exact effects of the wish depend on the wording of the wish and the DM's interpretation.

## Limits on Resurrection

There are limits to how many times a character can be returned from death:

- **Resurrection Survival**: Each time a character is raised from the dead (through raise dead, resurrection, or similar magic), they must make a resurrection survival roll based on their Constitution score. If the roll fails, the character cannot be returned to life.
- **Constitution Loss**: Each time a character is raised from the dead (through raise dead, resurrection, or similar magic), they permanently lose 1 point of Constitution. If their Constitution is reduced to 0, they cannot be returned to life.
- **Age Limit**: Characters who die of old age cannot typically be returned to life, as they have reached their natural lifespan.

## Conclusion

Death is a significant aspect of the AD&D game, adding an element of risk and consequence to the adventures of the characters. The possibility of resurrection or other forms of return from death provides hope and options for players whose characters have died, but the limitations and costs of these options ensure that death remains a meaningful and impactful event in the game.
