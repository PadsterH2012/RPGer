*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Experience point awards in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are the specific amounts of experience points (XP) granted to player characters for various accomplishments and activities. This section provides detailed information on experience point awards and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on determining appropriate awards for different situations.

## Monster Experience Point Awards

The most common source of experience points is defeating monsters:

- **Base Value by Hit Dice**: Each monster has a base experience point value determined by its hit dice, as shown in the following table:

| Monster Hit Dice | Base XP Value |
|------------------|---------------|
| Less than 1      | 5             |
| 1                | 10            |
| 1+               | 15            |

- **Special Abilities**: Monsters with special abilities provide additional experience points beyond their base value. Each special ability typically adds a percentage to the base value, as follows:
  - **Minor Abilities**: Each minor ability adds 10% to the base value. Examples include immunity to normal weapons, regeneration, or spell-like abilities.
  - **Major Abilities**: Each major ability adds 25% to the base value. Examples include breath weapons, level draining, or spell casting.
  - **Exceptional Abilities**: Each exceptional ability adds 50% or more to the base value, at the DM's discretion. Examples include unique or particularly powerful abilities.

- **Hit Point Adjustment**: Some DMs adjust the experience point award based on the monster's actual hit points compared to the average for its hit dice. For example, a monster with maximum hit points might provide 10-20% more experience points than one with average hit points.

- **Circumstantial Adjustment**: The DM may adjust experience point awards based on the specific circumstances of the encounter, such as whether the monster had tactical advantages or disadvantages, whether it was encountered in its lair, or whether it was able to use all of its abilities effectively.

## Treasure Experience Point Awards

Treasure provides experience points based on its monetary value:

- **Standard Conversion**: Non-magical treasure typically provides 1 XP per 1 gold piece (gp) of value.
- **Treasure Types**: Different types of treasure have different gold piece values:
  - **Coins**: Copper pieces (cp) are worth 1/100 gp, silver pieces (sp) are worth 1/10 gp, electrum pieces (ep) are worth 1/2 gp, gold pieces (gp) are worth 1 gp, and platinum pieces (pp) are worth 5 gp.
  - **Gems**: Gems have varying values, typically ranging from 10 gp to 5,000 gp or more, depending on the type and quality.
  - **Jewelry**: Jewelry items have varying values, typically ranging from 50 gp to 10,000 gp or more, depending on the materials, craftsmanship, and any gemstones.
  - **Art Objects**: Art objects have varying values, typically ranging from 100 gp to 25,000 gp or more, depending on the materials, craftsmanship, and artistic significance.
- **Magical Items**: Magical items typically do not provide experience points based on their gold piece value, as their value is in their use rather than their monetary worth.
- **Acquisition Requirement**: To earn experience points for treasure, characters must actually acquire the treasure and bring it to a safe location where it can be properly evaluated and secured.

## Quest and Story Experience Point Awards

Completing quests and advancing the story can provide significant experience points:

- **Minor Quests**: Minor quests, such as delivering a message, retrieving a common item, or defeating a minor threat, typically provide 50-500 XP, depending on the difficulty and importance.
- **Moderate Quests**: Moderate quests, such as recovering a valuable item, rescuing a prisoner, or defeating a significant threat, typically provide 500-2,000 XP, depending on the difficulty and importance.
- **Major Quests**: Major quests, such as recovering a powerful artifact, saving a town from destruction, or defeating a major villain, typically provide 2,000-10,000 XP or more, depending on the difficulty and importance.
- **Campaign Milestones**: Achieving significant milestones in the campaign, such as uncovering a major plot point, forming an important alliance, or reaching a new area, may provide experience points at the DM's discretion.
- **Personal Goals**: Achieving character-specific goals, such as avenging a family member, finding a lost heirloom, or establishing a stronghold, may provide experience points at the DM's discretion.

## Role-Playing Experience Point Awards

Effective role-playing can earn additional experience points:

- **Alignment Adherence**: Characters who consistently act in accordance with their alignment may receive bonus experience points, typically 10-25% of the experience earned from other sources during the session.
- **Character Development**: Characters who develop their personalities, backgrounds, and relationships in meaningful ways may receive bonus experience points, typically 50-200 XP per session.
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: Characters who solve problems in creative or unexpected ways may receive bonus experience points, typically 50-500 XP depending on the significance of the problem and the creativity of the solution.
- **Memorable Moments**: Characters who create memorable moments through their role-playing, such as delivering a stirring speech, making a dramatic sacrifice, or engaging in particularly entertaining interactions, may receive bonus experience points, typically 50-200 XP per moment.
- **Group Dynamics**: Characters who contribute positively to group dynamics, such as by mediating conflicts, supporting other characters, or making decisions that benefit the group as a whole, may receive bonus experience points, typically 50-200 XP per session.

## Class-Specific Experience Point Awards

Different character classes may receive experience points for class-specific accomplishments:

- **Clerics**: Clerics may receive experience points for promoting their deity's interests, converting new followers, establishing or maintaining temples, or performing significant religious ceremonies.
- **Druids**: Druids may receive experience points for protecting natural areas, maintaining the balance of nature, establishing sacred groves, or defeating those who despoil nature.
- **Fighters**: Fighters may receive experience points for defeating powerful opponents in single combat, leading troops effectively, establishing or defending strongholds, or demonstrating exceptional martial prowess.
- **Magic-Users**: Magic-users may receive experience points for discovering new spells, creating magical items, establishing or maintaining libraries or laboratories, or using magic in particularly clever or effective ways.

- **Thieves**: Thieves may receive experience points for successful use of thief skills, particularly difficult or daring heists, establishing or maintaining thieves' guilds, or gathering valuable information.

## Experience Point Division

Experience points are typically divided among the participating characters:

- **Equal Division**: Experience points from monsters and treasure are typically divided equally among all characters who participated in the encounter, regardless of their individual contributions.
- **Proportional Division**: Some DMs may choose to divide experience points proportionally based on each character's contribution to the encounter, though this requires careful judgment and can potentially create discord.
- **Class-Based Division**: Some DMs may adjust experience point division based on class, giving more to classes that were particularly relevant to the encounter (such as more to fighters for combat-heavy encounters or more to thieves for stealth-based encounters).
- **Level-Based Division**: Some DMs may adjust experience point division based on level, giving more to lower-level characters to help them catch up or more to higher-level characters to reflect their greater contribution.
- **Absent Characters**: Characters who are absent from a session typically receive reduced or no experience points for that session, though some DMs may grant a minimum amount to avoid excessive level disparities.

## Experience Point Caps and Minimums

The DM may establish caps or minimums for experience point awards:

- **Session Caps**: The DM may set a maximum amount of experience points that can be earned in a single session, preventing excessive level advancement from particularly successful sessions.
- **Session Minimums**: The DM may set a minimum amount of experience points that characters receive for participating in a session, ensuring steady progress even in sessions with limited combat or treasure.
- **Level-Based Caps**: The DM may set maximum experience point awards based on character level, with higher-level characters receiving reduced awards from lower-level challenges to reflect the reduced risk and difficulty.
- **Challenge-Based Minimums**: The DM may set minimum experience point awards for significant challenges, ensuring that characters are appropriately rewarded even if the challenge did not involve substantial combat or treasure.
- **Campaign-Based Adjustments**: The DM may adjust experience point awards based on the desired pace of the campaign, increasing awards to accelerate level advancement or decreasing them to slow it down.

## Conclusion

Experience point awards are a crucial aspect of the AD&D game, providing the mechanism for character advancement and serving as a reward system that encourages certain types of play. The DM should use these guidelines to create a fair and consistent system of experience point awards that supports the desired style and pace of the campaign while rewarding player skill, creativity, and engagement. By understanding the various sources of experience points and the factors that affect award amounts, the DM can create a balanced and satisfying progression for the characters throughout the campaign.
