# Training

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Training in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is the process by which characters who have accumulated sufficient experience points (XP) develop their skills and abilities to advance to the next level. This section provides detailed information on training and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on implementing training requirements in the campaign.

## Purpose of Training

Training serves several important purposes in the AD&D game:

- **Realism**: Training adds realism to character advancement, reflecting the fact that improved abilities and new skills require instruction, practice, and refinement rather than spontaneously appearing.
- **Pacing**: Training helps pace character advancement, preventing characters from gaining multiple levels in rapid succession and giving the DM and players time to adjust to new abilities.
- **Resource Management**: Training requires resources, particularly time and money, creating additional considerations for characters and potentially driving further adventures to acquire the necessary resources.
- **Campaign Integration**: Training provides opportunities to integrate characters more deeply into the campaign world through their relationships with trainers, training locations, and the activities that occur during training periods.
- **Downtime Activities**: Training creates natural periods of downtime during which other activities can occur, such as magical research, item creation, stronghold construction, or political developments.

## Training Requirements

To advance to a new level, characters typically must meet several requirements:

- **Experience Points**: The character must have accumulated the experience points required for the next level in their class.
- **Trainer**: The character must find a suitable trainer, typically a non-player character (NPC) of the same class who is at least two levels higher than the level the character is trying to attain.
- **Training Time**: The character must spend time training, typically 1-4 weeks depending on the class and level.
- **Training Cost**: The character must pay for the training, typically 1,500 gp per level being attained, multiplied by the number of weeks of training required.
- **Ability Requirements**: The character must meet any ability score requirements for the new level, particularly for classes with minimum ability score requirements for level advancement.

## Finding a Trainer

Finding a suitable trainer can be an adventure in itself:

- **Availability**: Trainers for lower levels (1-6) are relatively common in cities and large towns, while trainers for higher levels become increasingly rare and may require travel to specific locations.
- **Class Considerations**: Trainers for some classes, such as druids or paladins, may be particularly rare or found only in specific locations associated with their class.
- **Alignment Compatibility**: Trainers typically only train characters of compatible alignments, with good-aligned trainers refusing to train evil characters and vice versa.
- **Reputation and References**: High-level trainers may require references, proof of accomplishments, or specific quests before agreeing to train a character.
- **Special Requirements**: Some trainers may have special requirements beyond the standard training cost, such as service, specific magical items, or the completion of particular tasks.

## Training Time

The time required for training varies by class and level:

- **Base Time**: The base training time is typically 1-4 weeks, depending on the class:
  - **Fighters, Paladins, Rangers**: 1 week per level
  - **Clerics, Druids**: 2 weeks per level
  - **Magic-Users, Illusionists**: 3 weeks per level
  - **Thieves, Assassins**: 2 weeks per level
  - **Monks**: 3 weeks per level
  - **Bards**: 2 weeks per level
- **Level Factors**: Higher levels typically require more training time, with some DMs adding an additional week for every 3-4 levels.
- **Intelligence/Wisdom Factors**: Characters with high Intelligence or Wisdom (depending on the class) may reduce their training time, while those with low scores may increase it.
- **Continuous Requirement**: Training typically requires continuous, uninterrupted time. If training is interrupted for more than a day, it may need to be restarted or extended.
- **Daily Activities**: Training typically occupies 8-10 hours per day, leaving some time for other activities, though these should not be strenuous or dangerous enough to interfere with the training.

## Training Cost

Training requires a significant financial investment:

- **Base Cost**: The base cost for training is typically 1,500 gp per level being attained, multiplied by the number of weeks of training required.
- **Level Factors**: Higher levels typically cost more, with some DMs doubling the cost for every 4-5 levels.
- **Class Factors**: Some classes may have higher or lower training costs based on the rarity of trainers or the nature of the training.
- **Charisma Factors**: Characters with high Charisma may receive discounts on training costs, while those with low Charisma may have to pay more.
- **Relationship Factors**: Characters who have established positive relationships with potential trainers, such as through previous service or mutual acquaintances, may receive discounts.
- **Alternative Payment**: Some trainers may accept alternative forms of payment, such as service, specific items, or a percentage of future earnings, particularly if the character cannot afford the standard cost.

## Training Activities

Training involves various activities depending on the class:

- **Fighters, Paladins, Rangers**: Weapons practice, tactical exercises, physical conditioning, and study of famous battles and strategies.
- **Clerics, Druids**: Prayer, meditation, theological study, ritual practice, and service to the deity or nature.
- **Magic-Users, Illusionists**: Spell study, component preparation, magical theory, and controlled spell casting practice.
- **Thieves, Assassins**: Skill practice, study of locks and traps, stealth exercises, and analysis of potential targets.
- **Monks**: Meditation, martial arts practice, physical conditioning, and philosophical study.
- **Bards**: Performance practice, lore study, language practice, and observation of master bards.
- **All Classes**: Study of class-specific knowledge, practice of class abilities, and reflection on past experiences to extract lessons.

## Training Outcomes

Successful training results in several outcomes:

- **Level Advancement**: The character advances to the next level, gaining all the benefits associated with that level, such as increased hit points, improved combat abilities, new spells, or enhanced class abilities.
- **Skill Refinement**: The character refines existing skills and abilities, potentially receiving guidance on how to use them more effectively in future adventures.
- **Knowledge Acquisition**: The character acquires new knowledge relevant to their class, potentially including information about monsters, magical items, historical events, or other aspects of the campaign world.
- **Relationship Development**: The character develops a relationship with their trainer, potentially creating a valuable contact for future assistance, information, or further training.
- **Integration**: The character becomes more integrated into the structures and organizations associated with their class, such as fighters' guilds, clerical hierarchies, or arcane academies.

## Alternative Training Approaches

Some DMs may use alternative approaches to training:

- **Self-Training**: Characters with sufficient resources and knowledge may be able to train themselves, particularly at higher levels, though this typically takes longer and may have a chance of failure.
- **Group Training**: Characters of the same class may train together, potentially reducing costs but possibly increasing time due to the trainer's divided attention.
- **Adventure-Based Training**: Training may occur during adventures under the guidance of higher-level characters, with specific challenges designed to develop the skills needed for the next level.
- **Montage Approach**: Training may be handled narratively rather than tracking specific time and activities, with a brief description of the training process and its outcomes.
- **Waived Requirements**: In some campaigns, training requirements may be waived or reduced for practical reasons, such as limited availability of appropriate NPCs or to maintain the pace of the campaign.

## Training Failure

In some cases, training may fail:

- **Inability to Learn**: Characters with very low mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, depending on the class) may have a chance to fail their training, requiring additional time and money to try again.
- **Interruptions**: If training is interrupted by emergencies, attacks, or other significant events, it may fail and need to be restarted.
- **Incompatible Methods**: If the trainer's teaching methods are incompatible with the character's learning style, training may take longer or have a chance of failure.
- **Inadequate Resources**: If the character cannot provide the necessary resources for training, such as spell components for magic-users or sacred items for clerics, training may fail or be incomplete.
- **Consequences**: Failed training typically results in wasted time and money, with the character needing to find a new trainer or try again with the same trainer after addressing the issues that caused the failure.

## Conclusion

Training is an important aspect of character advancement in the AD&D game, adding realism, pacing, and campaign integration to the process of gaining levels. The DM should use these guidelines to implement training requirements that enhance the game experience while being practical and enjoyable for the players. By considering the various factors that affect training, such as availability of trainers, time requirements, costs, and activities, the DM can create a training system that adds depth to the campaign without becoming burdensome.
