## Benefits of Level Advancement

Advancing in level provides various benefits, depending on the character's class:

- **Hit Points**: Characters gain additional hit points when advancing in level, with the amount based on their class's hit die type and their Constitution bonus.
- **Combat Abilities**: Characters improve their combat abilities, with fighters and similar classes gaining better attack bonuses (THAC0) and potentially additional attacks per round at higher levels.
- **Saving Throws**: Characters' saving throws improve as they advance in level, making them more resistant to various harmful effects.
- **Spells**: Spellcasting classes gain access to more spells and higher-level spells as they advance, significantly increasing their power and versatility.
- **Class Abilities**: Characters gain new or improved class-specific abilities, such as thieves' skills, rangers' tracking abilities, or monks' special attacks.
- **Followers and Strongholds**: At higher levels (typically around 9th-11th level), characters may attract followers and establish strongholds, extending their influence in the campaign world.

## Hit Point Advancement

Hit points increase with each level advancement:

- **Hit Dice**: Each class has a specific hit die type (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12) that determines the range of hit points gained per level.
- **Constitution Bonus**: Characters with high Constitution scores receive a bonus to each hit die roll, while those with low Constitution may suffer a penalty.
- **First Level**: At first level, characters typically receive the maximum possible hit points for their class (e.g., 8 for a fighter with a d8 hit die) plus their Constitution bonus.
- **Subsequent Levels**: For subsequent levels, hit points are typically determined by rolling the appropriate hit die and adding the Constitution bonus, though some DMs may use alternative methods such as taking the average or allowing players to reroll very low results.
- **Level Limits**: Most classes stop gaining full hit dice at a certain level (typically 9th-11th level), after which they receive a fixed number of hit points per level (typically 1-3 plus Constitution bonus).

## Combat Advancement

Combat abilities improve with level advancement:

- **THAC0 Improvement**: A character's THAC0 (To Hit Armor Class 0) improves as they advance in level, with the rate of improvement depending on their class. Fighters and similar classes improve most quickly, while magic-users and similar classes improve most slowly.
- **Multiple Attacks**: Fighters and some other classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks per round at higher levels, typically starting around 7th level.
- **Weapon Specialization**: In campaigns using the weapon specialization optional rule, fighters may become more specialized in specific weapons as they advance, gaining additional bonuses to attack and damage.
- **Combat Options**: Higher-level characters may gain access to additional combat options, such as special maneuvers, improved critical hit chances, or reduced penalties for fighting with two weapons.
- **Saving Throw Improvement**: Saving throws improve with level advancement, with the specific improvements depending on the character's class and the type of saving throw.

## Spell Advancement

Spellcasting classes gain improved spell capabilities with level advancement:

- **Spell Slots**: Spellcasters gain additional spell slots as they advance in level, allowing them to cast more spells per day.
- **Spell Levels**: Spellcasters gain access to higher-level spells as they advance, with each new spell level typically becoming available every 2-3 character levels.
- **Spell Selection**: Magic-users and similar classes may learn new spells when advancing in level, typically 1-2 new spells per level gained, subject to Intelligence limits and availability.
- **Spell Effects**: Some spells have effects that scale with the caster's level, becoming more powerful as the character advances.
- **Spell Research**: Higher-level spellcasters may gain the ability to research new spells or create magical items, extending their magical capabilities beyond the standard spell list.

## Class-Specific Advancement

Different classes have specific advancement features:

- **Fighters**: Gain improved THAC0, multiple attacks, and potentially weapon specialization bonuses.
- **Paladins**: Gain improved THAC0, lay on hands healing, disease immunity, and eventually the ability to turn undead and cast cleric spells.
- **Rangers**: Gain improved THAC0, tracking abilities, and eventually limited spellcasting abilities.
- **Clerics**: Gain improved spellcasting, better turning undead abilities, and potentially the ability to create holy water or other religious items.
- **Druids**: Gain improved spellcasting, shape-shifting abilities, and immunity to certain natural hazards.
- **Magic-Users**: Gain access to more powerful spells, the ability to create magical items, and potentially the ability to attract apprentices.
- **Illusionists**: Gain access to more powerful illusion spells and eventually the ability to create permanent illusions.
- **Thieves**: Gain improved thieving abilities (pick pockets, open locks, find/remove traps, move silently, hide in shadows, hear noise, climb walls, and read languages), better backstab multipliers, and eventually the ability to read magical scrolls.
- **Assassins**: Gain improved assassination abilities, disguise skills, and eventually limited spellcasting abilities.
- **Monks**: Gain improved unarmed combat abilities, increased movement rate, and various special abilities such as stunning strikes, feign death, and speak with animals.
- **Bards**: Gain improved charm abilities, bardic knowledge, and eventually limited spellcasting abilities.

## Name Level and Beyond

Around 9th-11th level, depending on the class, characters reach "name level" and gain significant new capabilities:

- **Stronghold Establishment**: Characters can establish strongholds appropriate to their class, such as castles for fighters, temples for clerics, towers for magic-users, or guilds for thieves.
- **Follower Attraction**: Characters attract followers appropriate to their class, ranging from men-at-arms for fighters to apprentices for magic-users or acolytes for clerics.
- **Title Acquisition**: Characters may acquire formal titles within their class's hierarchy, such as "Lord" for fighters, "High Priest" for clerics, or "Master Thief" for thieves.
- **Political Influence**: Characters may gain political influence in the campaign world, becoming important figures in kingdoms, religious organizations, or arcane societies.
- **Epic Challenges**: Characters may face epic-level challenges, such as confronting demon princes, overthrowing kingdoms, or preventing world-threatening catastrophes.

## Multi-Class and Dual-Class Advancement

Multi-class and dual-class characters have special advancement considerations:

- **Multi-Class Experience Division**: Multi-class characters divide their experience points equally among their classes, potentially advancing in different classes at different rates due to varying experience point requirements.
- **Multi-Class Level Limits**: Non-human multi-class characters are subject to racial level limits in most classes, potentially reaching the maximum level in one class while still advancing in others.
- **Dual-Class Requirements**: To dual-class (humans only), a character must have a score of at least 15 in the prime requisite of the new class and at least 17 in the prime requisite of the original class.
- **Dual-Class Restrictions**: Dual-class characters cannot use the abilities of their original class until their level in the new class exceeds their level in the original class, except for thieves' abilities, which can be used without restriction.
- **Dual-Class Experience**: Dual-class characters receive experience only for their new class, not their original class, and do not advance further in their original class.

## Conclusion

Level advancement is a fundamental aspect of the AD&D game, providing the mechanism for character growth and development over the course of a campaign. The DM should use these guidelines to manage level advancement in a way that creates a satisfying progression for the players while maintaining game balance and narrative coherence. By understanding the experience point requirements, benefits, and special considerations for different classes and advancement types, the DM can create a campaign that accommodates characters of various levels and provides appropriate challenges and rewards throughout their adventuring careers.
