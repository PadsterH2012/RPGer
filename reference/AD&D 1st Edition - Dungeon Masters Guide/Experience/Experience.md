# Experience

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Experience in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game represents the growth and development of player characters as they face challenges, overcome obstacles, and learn from their adventures. This section provides an overview of experience and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on awarding and managing experience points in the campaign.

## Nature of Experience

Experience in the AD&D game has the following characteristics:

- **Quantitative Measurement**: Experience is measured in experience points (XP), which are numerical values awarded for various accomplishments and activities.
- **Level Advancement**: Accumulating experience points allows characters to advance in level, gaining new abilities, improved combat prowess, and other benefits.
- **Class-Based Requirements**: Different character classes have different experience point requirements for level advancement, reflecting the varying complexity and power of different classes.
- **Varied Sources**: Experience points come from multiple sources, including defeating monsters, acquiring treasure, completing quests, and role-playing effectively.
- **DM Discretion**: The DM has significant discretion in awarding experience points, particularly for non-combat accomplishments, allowing for customization based on campaign style and goals.

## Sources of Experience Points

Experience points come from several sources:

- **Monster Defeat**: Characters earn experience points for defeating monsters, with the amount based on the monster's hit dice, special abilities, and other factors.
- **Treasure Acquisition**: Characters earn experience points for acquiring treasure, typically at a rate of 1 XP per 1 gold piece value of non-magical treasure.
- **Spell Use**: Magic-users and other spellcasters may earn experience points for using spells to overcome challenges, particularly when the spells are used creatively or effectively.
- **Quest Completion**: Characters earn experience points for completing quests or achieving significant goals, with the amount based on the difficulty and importance of the quest.
- **Role-Playing**: Characters may earn experience points for effective role-playing, including acting in accordance with their alignment, developing their character's personality, or making decisions that enhance the game.
- **Story Advancement**: Characters may earn experience points for advancing the campaign story, uncovering important information, or making significant discoveries.

## Experience Points for Monsters

The primary source of experience points is defeating monsters:

- **Base Value**: Each monster has a base experience point value determined by its hit dice, with higher hit dice monsters providing more experience points.
- **Special Abilities**: Monsters with special abilities, such as spell-like powers, immunities, or unusual attack forms, provide additional experience points.
- **Exceptional Abilities**: Monsters with exceptional abilities, such as breath weapons, level draining, or spell casting, provide even more additional experience points.
- **Defeat Definition**: "Defeating" a monster does not necessarily mean killing it. Monsters can be defeated by capturing them, driving them away, or otherwise neutralizing the threat they pose.
- **Group Division**: Experience points for defeated monsters are typically divided equally among all characters who participated in the defeat, regardless of their individual contributions.

## Experience Points for Treasure

Treasure is another significant source of experience points:

- **Conversion Rate**: Non-magical treasure typically provides 1 XP per 1 gold piece of value.
- **Acquisition Requirement**: To earn experience points for treasure, characters must actually acquire the treasure and bring it to a safe location where it can be properly evaluated and secured.
- **Magical Items**: Magical items typically do not provide experience points based on their gold piece value, as their value is in their use rather than their monetary worth.
- **Group Division**: Experience points for treasure are typically divided among all characters who participated in acquiring it, regardless of how the treasure itself is divided.
- **Story-Based Treasure**: Some treasure may have story significance beyond its monetary value, potentially providing additional experience points at the DM's discretion.

## Experience Points for Other Accomplishments

Various other accomplishments can provide experience points:

- **Spell Use**: Creative or effective use of spells to overcome challenges may provide experience points, particularly for spellcasting classes.
- **Skill Use**: Effective use of class skills, such as a thief's ability to pick locks or a ranger's tracking ability, may provide experience points.
- **Problem Solving**: Solving puzzles, riddles, or other intellectual challenges may provide experience points.
- **Diplomacy**: Successfully negotiating with NPCs, forming alliances, or resolving conflicts through diplomacy may provide experience points.
- **Exploration**: Exploring new areas, mapping unknown territories, or discovering hidden locations may provide experience points.
- **Character Development**: Significant character development, such as establishing relationships with NPCs, pursuing personal goals, or making meaningful choices, may provide experience points.

## Level Advancement

Accumulating experience points allows characters to advance in level:

- **Class-Based Requirements**: Each character class has its own experience point requirements for level advancement, with some classes requiring more points than others to reflect their power and versatility.
- **Training Requirement**: In many campaigns, characters must receive training from a higher-level character of the same class to advance in level, requiring time and potentially money.
- **Level Benefits**: Advancing in level provides various benefits, including increased hit points, improved combat abilities, new spells or spell slots, and class-specific abilities.
- **Multi-Class Advancement**: Multi-class characters divide their experience points equally among their classes, potentially advancing in different classes at different rates due to varying experience point requirements.
- **Dual-Class Advancement**: Dual-class characters (humans only) stop advancing in their original class and begin advancing in their new class, with special rules for when they can use abilities from their original class.

## Managing Experience Awards

The DM should consider the following factors when awarding experience points:

- **Consistency**: Experience point awards should be consistent from session to session and adventure to adventure, avoiding sudden spikes or droughts that could disrupt the campaign's progression.
- **Balance**: Experience point awards should be balanced among different sources, encouraging a variety of play styles and approaches rather than focusing exclusively on combat or treasure acquisition.
- **Group Dynamics**: Experience point awards should consider group dynamics, potentially providing individual bonuses for exceptional contributions while maintaining overall group cohesion.
- **Campaign Pace**: Experience point awards should support the desired pace of the campaign, with more generous awards accelerating level advancement and more conservative awards slowing it down.
- **Player Motivation**: Experience point awards should motivate players to engage with the game in ways that enhance the experience for everyone, rewarding cooperation, creativity, and role-playing.

## Experience Point Penalties

In some circumstances, characters may receive experience point penalties:

- **Alignment Violations**: Characters who act contrary to their alignment may receive experience point penalties, reflecting the internal conflict and lack of focus caused by such actions.
- **Class Restrictions**: Characters who violate class restrictions, such as a paladin committing an evil act or a druid using metal armor, may receive experience point penalties.
- **Poor Play**: Characters whose players consistently make poor decisions, fail to engage with the game, or disrupt the enjoyment of others may receive experience point penalties at the DM's discretion.
- **Inactivity**: Characters who are inactive during significant portions of an adventure, whether due to player absence or character incapacitation, may receive reduced experience points.
- **Training Failure**: Characters who fail to properly train between levels may receive experience point penalties or be unable to advance until proper training is completed.

## Experience Levels and Character Power

Experience levels represent significant increases in character power:

- **Exponential Progression**: The experience point requirements for level advancement typically increase exponentially, reflecting the increasing difficulty of further improvement as characters become more powerful.
- **Power Jumps**: Certain levels represent significant jumps in power due to the acquisition of new abilities, such as 3rd level for clerics (2nd-level spells), 5th level for magic-users (3rd-level spells), or 9th level for fighters (multiple attacks).
- **Name Level**: Around 9th-11th level, depending on the class, characters reach "name level," where they can establish strongholds, attract followers, and take on more significant roles in the campaign world.
- **High-Level Play**: At very high levels (15+), characters become extremely powerful, capable of facing the most dangerous monsters and affecting the campaign world on a large scale.
- **Level Limits**: Non-human characters have level limits in most classes, reflecting the different potentials and focuses of different races.

## Conclusion

Experience is a fundamental aspect of the AD&D game, providing a mechanism for character growth and development while also serving as a reward system that encourages certain types of play. The DM should use the experience point system to create a satisfying progression for the characters while also shaping the campaign according to their vision and the players' preferences. By understanding the sources of experience points and the factors that affect experience awards, the DM can create a balanced and engaging campaign that rewards player skill, creativity, and engagement.
