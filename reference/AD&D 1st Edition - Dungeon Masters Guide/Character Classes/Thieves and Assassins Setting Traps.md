# Thieves and Assassins Setting Traps

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In addition to finding and removing traps, thieves and assassins in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game can also set traps to catch or harm their enemies. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling trap-setting by thieves and assassins in the campaign.

## Types of Traps

There are several types of traps that thieves and assassins may set:

- **Snares and Pits**: These traps are designed to catch or immobilize the target. They may include rope snares, pit traps, or net traps.
- **Alarm Traps**: These traps are designed to alert the thief or assassin to the presence of intruders. They may include tripwires connected to bells or other noisemakers.
- **Damaging Traps**: These traps are designed to harm or kill the target. They may include poisoned needles, spring-loaded blades, or falling weights.
- **Combination Traps**: These traps combine elements of the above types. For example, a pit trap might have spikes at the bottom (combining a snare with a damaging trap), or a poisoned needle trap might be connected to an alarm (combining a damaging trap with an alarm trap).

## Setting Traps

When a thief or assassin sets a trap, the DM should consider the following factors:

- **The Character's Level**: Higher-level thieves and assassins are more skilled at setting traps and can create more complex and effective traps.
- **The Type of Trap**: Different types of traps have different difficulties to set. Simple alarm traps might be relatively easy, while complex combination traps might be more difficult.
- **The Materials Available**: The character must have appropriate materials to set the trap. For example, setting a pit trap requires tools for digging, while setting a poisoned needle trap requires poison.
- **The Time Available**: Setting a trap takes time. Simple traps might take minutes, while complex traps might take hours or even days.

## Resolving Trap-Setting Attempts

The DM should resolve trap-setting attempts based on the character's level, the type of trap, the materials available, and the time available. The following methods can be used:

- **Ability Checks**: For simple traps, the DM may require an ability check, such as a Dexterity check for setting a delicate trigger or an Intelligence check for designing a complex mechanism.
- **Skill Percentages**: The DM may use the character's find/remove traps percentage as a guideline for their ability to set traps. For example, a character with a 50% chance to find and remove traps might have a 50% chance to successfully set a trap of similar complexity.
- **Role-Playing**: For complex trap-setting, the DM may resolve the attempt through role-playing, with the player describing their character's actions and the DM describing the results.

## Trap Effects

The effects of a trap set by a thief or assassin depend on the type of trap and the skill of the character setting it. The following guidelines apply:

- **Snares and Pits**: These traps typically immobilize the target, making them vulnerable to attack or capture. The target may be allowed a saving throw to avoid the trap, with the difficulty based on the skill of the character setting the trap.
- **Alarm Traps**: These traps alert the character to the presence of intruders. The effectiveness of the alarm depends on the design of the trap and the distance between the trap and the character.
- **Damaging Traps**: These traps cause damage to the target. The amount of damage depends on the design of the trap and the skill of the character setting it. For example, a simple tripwire connected to a swinging log might cause 1d6 damage, while a complex spring-loaded blade trap might cause 2d6 damage.
- **Poisoned Traps**: Traps that use poison can be particularly deadly. The target is typically allowed a saving throw against poison, with failure resulting in the normal effects of the poison used.

## Detecting and Disarming Character-Set Traps

Traps set by thieves and assassins can be detected and disarmed using the normal rules for finding and removing traps. The following guidelines apply:

- **Detection Difficulty**: The difficulty of detecting a trap set by a character depends on the skill of the character setting the trap and the design of the trap. As a guideline, the base chance to detect the trap might be 100% minus the trap-setter's find/remove traps percentage.
- **Disarming Difficulty**: The difficulty of disarming a trap set by a character follows similar guidelines to detection. The base chance to disarm the trap might be 100% minus the trap-setter's find/remove traps percentage.
- **Consequences of Failure**: If a character fails to detect or disarm a trap set by another character, the trap functions as designed. If the character fails to disarm the trap by more than 20%, they trigger the trap.

## Ethical Considerations

The setting of traps, particularly damaging or lethal traps, raises ethical considerations that the DM and players should address:

- **Alignment Considerations**: The setting of traps, particularly those designed to kill, may be inconsistent with certain alignments. For example, a lawful good character might have moral objections to setting lethal traps in areas where innocent bystanders might trigger them.
- **Legal Considerations**: In many settings, the setting of traps, particularly lethal ones, may be illegal. Characters who set such traps may face legal consequences if discovered.
- **Practical Considerations**: Traps do not discriminate between targets. A trap set for an enemy might be triggered by an ally, an innocent bystander, or even the character who set the trap if they forget its location.

## Conclusion

The ability to set traps adds depth to the thief and assassin classes, providing them with additional options for dealing with enemies and protecting their territory. The DM should use these guidelines to handle trap-setting in a way that is challenging but fair, and that enhances the game experience for the players.
