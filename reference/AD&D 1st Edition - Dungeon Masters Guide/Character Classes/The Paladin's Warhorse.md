# The Paladin's Warhorse

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

One of the special abilities of the paladin class in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is the ability to summon a special warhorse. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling the paladin's warhorse in the campaign.

## Summoning the Warhorse

A paladin can summon a special warhorse when they reach 4th level. The following guidelines apply to the summoning:

- **Frequency**: A paladin can summon a warhorse only once every 10 years. If the warhorse is lost or killed, the paladin must wait for the remainder of the 10-year period before summoning another.
- **Method**: The paladin must pray for the warhorse, typically during a period of meditation or at a holy site. The specific details of the summoning ritual can be determined by the DM, based on the paladin's deity and the campaign setting.
- **Arrival**: The warhorse typically arrives within 1-4 weeks of the summoning. It may appear suddenly, or it may be brought to the paladin by a servant of the paladin's deity.

## Characteristics of the Warhorse

The paladin's warhorse is a special mount, superior to ordinary warhorses. The following characteristics apply:

- **Intelligence**: The warhorse has an Intelligence of 5-10 (1d6+4), making it significantly more intelligent than an ordinary horse.
- **Hit Dice**: The warhorse has 5-8 Hit Dice (5d8+3), with the exact number determined by the DM.
- **Armor Class**: The warhorse has an Armor Class of 5 (equivalent to chain mail), representing its natural toughness and agility.
- **Movement**: The warhorse has a movement rate of 18", making it faster than an ordinary warhorse.
- **Combat Abilities**: The warhorse can attack with its hooves, causing 1-8 points of damage per hoof. It is also trained for war and will not panic in combat.
- **Special Abilities**: The warhorse has special abilities that vary depending on its Intelligence. These may include the ability to understand complex commands, to act independently in combat, or to sense danger.

## The Bond Between Paladin and Warhorse

The paladin and the warhorse share a special bond, which affects their relationship and interactions:

- **Loyalty**: The warhorse is completely loyal to the paladin and will serve faithfully until death.
- **Communication**: The paladin and the warhorse can communicate on a basic level, with the warhorse understanding simple commands and the paladin understanding the warhorse's reactions and behaviors.
- **Empathy**: The paladin and the warhorse share an empathic bond, allowing them to sense each other's emotions and general state of well-being.
- **Training**: The warhorse is already trained for war and for service to the paladin. It does not require additional training, though the paladin and the warhorse may need time to become accustomed to each other.

## Care and Maintenance of the Warhorse

The paladin is responsible for the care and maintenance of the warhorse. The following guidelines apply:

- **Food and Water**: The warhorse requires food and water appropriate for its size and activity level. The paladin must ensure that these needs are met.
- **Shelter**: The warhorse requires shelter appropriate for the climate and conditions. The paladin must ensure that this need is met.
- **Equipment**: The paladin is responsible for providing appropriate equipment for the warhorse, including saddle, bridle, and any armor.
- **Medical Care**: The paladin is responsible for providing medical care for the warhorse if it is injured or ill. The paladin's ability to cure by laying on hands can be used to heal the warhorse.

## Loss of the Warhorse

If the paladin's warhorse is lost or killed, the following guidelines apply:

- **Waiting Period**: The paladin must wait for the remainder of the 10-year period before summoning another warhorse.
- **Emotional Impact**: The loss of the warhorse can have a significant emotional impact on the paladin, given the special bond they share. The DM may wish to role-play this aspect of the loss.
- **Responsibility**: If the warhorse was lost or killed due to the paladin's negligence or poor decisions, the DM may impose additional consequences, such as a temporary loss of other paladin abilities or a quest of atonement.

## Conclusion

The paladin's warhorse is a significant aspect of the paladin class, providing both practical benefits in terms of transportation and combat support, and role-playing opportunities in terms of the bond between the paladin and the warhorse. The DM should use these guidelines to handle the paladin's warhorse in a way that enhances the game experience for the paladin player and the group as a whole.
