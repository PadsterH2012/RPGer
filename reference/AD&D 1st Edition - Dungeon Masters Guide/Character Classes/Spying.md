# Spying

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Spying is an activity that may be undertaken by various character classes in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, particularly thieves and assassins. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling spying activities in the campaign.

## Types of Spying

There are several types of spying activities that characters may undertake:

- **Reconnaissance**: This involves observing an area or group to gather information about their numbers, positions, activities, or other characteristics. This type of spying is typically conducted from a distance and may involve the use of hiding, disguise, or other stealth techniques.
- **Infiltration**: This involves entering a restricted area or group to gather information from within. This type of spying is typically more dangerous than reconnaissance, as it involves a greater risk of discovery.
- **Eavesdropping**: This involves listening to conversations or other communications to gather information. This type of spying may be conducted from hiding, or it may involve the use of magical or mechanical means to hear conversations from a distance.
- **Document Theft**: This involves stealing or copying documents to gather information. This type of spying may involve breaking into secure areas, picking locks, or other thief skills.

## Character Classes and Spying

Different character classes have different abilities that can be useful for spying:

- **Thieves**: Thieves are particularly well-suited for spying, with abilities such as move silently, hide in shadows, pick pockets, and open locks. These abilities allow them to move undetected, access restricted areas, and gather information without being discovered.
- **Assassins**: Assassins, as a subclass of thieves, have all the thief abilities useful for spying. In addition, they have the ability to disguise themselves, which can be particularly useful for infiltration.
- **Rangers**: Rangers have the ability to move silently and hide in shadows in natural surroundings, which can be useful for reconnaissance in wilderness areas.
- **Magic-Users and Illusionists**: These classes have access to spells such as invisibility, clairvoyance, and ESP, which can be extremely useful for spying. However, they lack the physical stealth abilities of thieves and assassins.
- **Clerics and Druids**: These classes have access to spells such as know alignment and commune, which can provide information about individuals or situations. However, like magic-users, they lack the physical stealth abilities of thieves and assassins.

## Conducting Spying Activities

When a character undertakes a spying activity, the DM should consider the following factors:

- **The Character's Abilities**: The character's class abilities, skills, and equipment will affect their chances of success. For example, a thief with high move silently and hide in shadows percentages will be more effective at spying than a fighter with no stealth abilities.
- **The Target's Defenses**: The target's security measures, awareness, and countermeasures will affect the difficulty of the spying activity. For example, spying on a paranoid wizard with magical alarms and guards will be more difficult than spying on an unsuspecting merchant.
- **The Environment**: The physical environment will affect the character's ability to spy. For example, a dark, noisy tavern may provide cover for eavesdropping, while a well-lit, open courtyard may make hiding difficult.
- **The Information Sought**: The specificity and sensitivity of the information sought will affect the difficulty of the spying activity. For example, learning the general layout of a castle may be easier than discovering the secret password to a hidden vault.

## Resolving Spying Attempts

The DM should resolve spying attempts based on the character's abilities, the target's defenses, the environment, and the information sought. The following methods can be used:

- **Ability Checks**: For simple spying activities, the DM may require an ability check, such as a Dexterity check for moving silently or an Intelligence check for understanding overheard information.
- **Skill Percentages**: For thieves and assassins, the DM should use the character's skill percentages for activities such as moving silently, hiding in shadows, or picking pockets.
- **Saving Throws**: For targets of spying, the DM may allow saving throws to notice the spy, resist magical spying methods, or otherwise counter the spying attempt.
- **Role-Playing**: For complex spying activities, the DM may resolve the attempt through role-playing, with the player describing their character's actions and the DM describing the results.

## Consequences of Spying

The consequences of spying can vary widely, depending on the success of the attempt and the reaction of the target:

- **Success**: If the spying attempt is successful, the character gains the information sought. The DM should provide this information in a way that is useful but not overly detailed, leaving room for player interpretation and further investigation.
- **Partial Success**: If the spying attempt is partially successful, the character gains some but not all of the information sought, or the information may be incomplete or misleading.
- **Failure**: If the spying attempt fails, the character does not gain the information sought. The DM should determine whether the failure is known to the character (they realize they didn't get the information) or unknown (they think they got accurate information, but it's actually wrong).
- **Discovery**: If the character is discovered while spying, the consequences can range from embarrassment to imprisonment or execution, depending on the target and the nature of the spying. The DM should consider the target's alignment, personality, and resources when determining their reaction to discovering a spy.

## Conclusion

Spying can add depth and intrigue to an AD&D campaign, providing opportunities for stealth, deception, and information gathering. The DM should use these guidelines to handle spying activities in a way that is challenging but fair, and that enhances the game experience for the players.
