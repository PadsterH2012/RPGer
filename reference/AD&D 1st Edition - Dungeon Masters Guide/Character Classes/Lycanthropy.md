# Lycanthropy

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Lycanthropy is a condition in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game that transforms a character into a were-creature, such as a werewolf, wererat, or werebear. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling lycanthropy in the campaign.

## Types of Lycanthropy

There are several types of lycanthropy, each associated with a different animal form:

- **Werewolf**: The most common form of lycanthropy, transforming the character into a wolf-human hybrid.
- **Wererat**: A form of lycanthropy that transforms the character into a rat-human hybrid.
- **Werebear**: A form of lycanthropy that transforms the character into a bear-human hybrid.
- **Wereboar**: A form of lycanthropy that transforms the character into a boar-human hybrid.
- **Weretiger**: A form of lycanthropy that transforms the character into a tiger-human hybrid.

## Contracting Lycanthropy

Characters can contract lycanthropy in several ways:

- **Wounds**: The most common method is through wounds inflicted by a lycanthrope. If a character is wounded by a lycanthrope and survives, they must make a saving throw versus poison. If the saving throw fails, the character contracts lycanthropy.
- **Curse**: Some curses can inflict lycanthropy. These curses might be placed by powerful spellcasters, magical items, or other sources.
- **Inheritance**: In some campaign settings, lycanthropy can be inherited. Children of lycanthropes may be born with the condition.

## Progression of Lycanthropy

Once a character contracts lycanthropy, the condition progresses as follows:

- **Incubation Period**: There is typically an incubation period of 2-24 days before the character begins to transform.
- **Initial Transformation**: The first transformation typically occurs during the full moon. The character transforms into their were-form and loses control of their actions, typically becoming aggressive and predatory.
- **Subsequent Transformations**: After the initial transformation, the character typically transforms during each full moon. As the condition progresses, the character may begin to transform at other times as well, particularly during periods of stress or anger.
- **Full Lycanthropy**: Eventually, the character reaches a state of full lycanthropy, where they can transform at will and retain control of their actions in were-form. The time to reach this state varies, but it typically takes several months.

## Effects of Lycanthropy

Lycanthropy has several effects on a character:

- **Physical Transformation**: The most obvious effect is the physical transformation into the were-form. This transformation includes changes to the character's appearance, physical abilities, and natural weapons.
- **Mental Changes**: Lycanthropy also affects the character's mind, particularly during transformations. The character may become more aggressive, predatory, or in tune with their animal nature.
- **Alignment Shift**: Lycanthropy can cause a shift in the character's alignment. The specific shift depends on the type of lycanthropy: werewolves and wererats tend toward evil, werebears toward good, and wereboars and weretigers toward neutrality.
- **Immunity to Normal Weapons**: Lycanthropes are immune to damage from normal weapons. Only silver weapons or magical weapons can harm them.
- **Regeneration**: Some lycanthropes have the ability to regenerate damage, healing wounds quickly.

## Curing Lycanthropy

Lycanthropy can be cured in several ways:

- **Remove Curse**: The remove curse spell can cure lycanthropy if cast during the incubation period or within a few days of the first transformation. After that, more powerful magic is required.
- **Wish**: The wish spell can cure lycanthropy at any stage.
- **Belladonna**: The herb belladonna can suppress the symptoms of lycanthropy temporarily and, if administered correctly, can provide a chance for a permanent cure. However, belladonna is also a poison and can cause harm or death if misused.
- **Special Rituals**: In some campaign settings, there may be special rituals or procedures that can cure lycanthropy. These might involve rare ingredients, specific locations, or particular times.

## Lycanthropes as Player Characters

In some campaigns, players may wish to play lycanthrope characters. The DM should consider the following factors:

- **Game Balance**: Lycanthropes have significant advantages, such as immunity to normal weapons and potentially powerful natural attacks. These advantages can disrupt game balance.
- **Role-Playing Challenges**: Playing a lycanthrope presents unique role-playing challenges, particularly regarding the character's control over their transformations and their potential alignment shift.
- **Campaign Impact**: The inclusion of a lycanthrope player character can affect the tone and theme of the campaign. The DM should consider whether this fits with the desired tone and theme.

If the DM decides to allow lycanthrope player characters, the following adjustments might be made:

- **Limited Immunity**: The character might have resistance rather than immunity to normal weapons, or their immunity might be limited to their were-form.
- **Controlled Transformations**: The character might have more control over their transformations than a typical lycanthrope, perhaps being able to resist unwanted transformations with a successful saving throw.
- **Alignment Stability**: The character might be able to resist the alignment shift associated with their lycanthropy, perhaps with a successful Wisdom check or through role-playing efforts.

## Conclusion

Lycanthropy adds an element of horror and transformation to the AD&D game, providing both challenges for players whose characters contract the condition and opportunities for unique character concepts. The DM should use these guidelines to handle lycanthropy in a way that enhances the game experience for all players.
