# Thief Abilities

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Thieves in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game have a unique set of special abilities that set them apart from other character classes. These abilities allow thieves to perform tasks such as picking pockets, moving silently, and finding and removing traps. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling thief abilities in the campaign.

## Thief Ability Percentages

Thief abilities are expressed as percentages, representing the chance of success when the ability is used. The base percentages for a 1st-level thief are as follows:

- **Pick Pockets**: 30%
- **Open Locks**: 25%
- **Find/Remove Traps**: 20%
- **Move Silently**: 15%
- **Hide in Shadows**: 10%
- **Hear Noise**: 10%
- **Climb Walls**: 85%
- **Read Languages**: 0%

These percentages increase as the thief gains levels, with different abilities increasing at different rates. In addition, the thief's race and Dexterity score can provide adjustments to these percentages.

## Using Thief Abilities

When a thief uses one of their special abilities, the DM should handle the attempt as follows:

1. **Determine the Base Percentage**: Start with the thief's base percentage for the ability, as determined by their level, race, and Dexterity score.
2. **Apply Situational Modifiers**: Adjust the percentage based on the specific circumstances. For example, picking the pocket of an alert guard might impose a -20% penalty, while picking the pocket of a drunk might grant a +10% bonus.
3. **Roll the Dice**: Roll percentile dice (d100) to determine if the attempt is successful. If the roll is equal to or less than the adjusted percentage, the attempt succeeds. If the roll is greater than the adjusted percentage, the attempt fails.
4. **Determine the Consequences**: Based on the success or failure of the attempt, determine the consequences. For example, a successful pick pockets attempt might yield a valuable item, while a failed attempt might result in the thief being caught.

## Specific Thief Abilities

Each thief ability has its own specific rules and considerations:

### Pick Pockets

This ability allows the thief to steal items from a person without being detected. The following guidelines apply:

- **Target Awareness**: If the target is aware of the thief's presence, the attempt suffers a -5% penalty for each level of the target above 1st level.
- **Item Size**: The size of the item affects the difficulty of the attempt. Small items like coins or gems are easier to steal than large items like weapons or armor.
- **Detection**: If the thief fails the pick pockets roll by more than 20%, they are detected in the act. The DM should determine the target's reaction based on their alignment, personality, and the circumstances.

### Open Locks

This ability allows the thief to open locks without the proper key. The following guidelines apply:

- **Lock Complexity**: The complexity of the lock affects the difficulty of the attempt. Simple locks might grant a bonus, while complex locks might impose a penalty.
- **Tools**: The thief must have thieves' tools to use this ability. Without tools, the attempt is made at a significant penalty or may be impossible.
- **Time**: Opening a lock typically takes 1 round (1 minute). If the thief fails, they can try again, but each attempt takes another round.

### Find/Remove Traps

This ability allows the thief to locate and disarm traps. The following guidelines apply:

- **Trap Complexity**: The complexity of the trap affects the difficulty of the attempt. Simple traps might grant a bonus, while complex traps might impose a penalty.
- **Tools**: The thief must have thieves' tools to remove most traps. Without tools, the attempt is made at a significant penalty or may be impossible.
- **Time**: Finding a trap typically takes 1 round (1 minute), and removing a trap typically takes another round. If the thief fails, they can try again, but each attempt takes another round.
- **Consequences of Failure**: If the thief fails to find a trap, they may trigger it if they interact with the trapped object. If the thief fails to remove a trap by more than 20%, they trigger the trap.

### Move Silently

This ability allows the thief to move without making noise. The following guidelines apply:

- **Surface**: The surface the thief is moving on affects the difficulty of the attempt. Soft surfaces like carpet might grant a bonus, while noisy surfaces like gravel might impose a penalty.
- **Speed**: The thief must move at half their normal movement rate when using this ability.
- **Detection**: If the thief fails the move silently roll, they make noise and may be detected by nearby creatures. The DM should determine if any creatures hear the noise based on their distance, the ambient noise level, and other factors.

### Hide in Shadows

This ability allows the thief to hide in areas of shadow or darkness. The following guidelines apply:

- **Lighting**: The lighting conditions affect the difficulty of the attempt. Complete darkness might grant a bonus, while bright light might impose a penalty or make the attempt impossible.
- **Cover**: The availability of cover affects the difficulty of the attempt. Good cover might grant a bonus, while minimal cover might impose a penalty.
- **Movement**: The thief must remain stationary when using this ability. If they move, they must make a new hide in shadows roll.
- **Detection**: If the thief fails the hide in shadows roll, they are visible and may be detected by nearby creatures. The DM should determine if any creatures see the thief based on their distance, the lighting conditions, and other factors.

### Hear Noise

This ability allows the thief to hear faint or distant sounds. The following guidelines apply:

- **Ambient Noise**: The ambient noise level affects the difficulty of the attempt. Quiet environments might grant a bonus, while noisy environments might impose a penalty.
- **Distance**: The distance to the sound affects the difficulty of the attempt. Nearby sounds might grant a bonus, while distant sounds might impose a penalty.
- **Concentration**: The thief must be concentrating to use this ability. They cannot be engaged in combat or other activities that require attention.

### Climb Walls

This ability allows the thief to climb vertical surfaces without equipment. The following guidelines apply:

- **Surface**: The nature of the surface affects the difficulty of the attempt. Rough surfaces with many handholds might grant a bonus, while smooth surfaces might impose a penalty.
- **Speed**: The thief climbs at a rate of 3" (30 feet) per round.
- **Falling**: If the thief fails the climb walls roll, they fall. The DM should determine the damage based on the height of the fall.

### Read Languages

This ability allows the thief to read languages they do not know. The following guidelines apply:

- **Language Complexity**: The complexity of the language affects the difficulty of the attempt. Simple languages might grant a bonus, while complex or obscure languages might impose a penalty.
- **Time**: Reading a language typically takes 1 turn (10 minutes) per page or equivalent.
- **Comprehension**: Even with a successful roll, the thief's understanding of the language is imperfect. The DM should provide a general summary of the content rather than a word-for-word translation.

## Conclusion

Thief abilities are a defining feature of the thief class, providing unique capabilities that set thieves apart from other character classes. The DM should use these guidelines to handle thief abilities in a way that is challenging but fair, and that enhances the game experience for the thief player and the group as a whole.
