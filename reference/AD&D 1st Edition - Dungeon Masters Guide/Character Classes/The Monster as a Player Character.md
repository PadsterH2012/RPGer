# The Monster as a Player Character

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In some campaigns, players may wish to play monster characters rather than the standard player character races. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling monster player characters in the campaign.

## Considerations for Monster Player Characters

Before allowing monster player characters in a campaign, the DM should consider the following factors:

- **Game Balance**: Monster characters may have abilities that are significantly more powerful than those of standard player characters, which can disrupt game balance. The DM should carefully consider whether the monster's abilities would give the player an unfair advantage.
- **Campaign Setting**: The inclusion of monster player characters can affect the tone and theme of the campaign setting. The DM should consider whether monster player characters fit with the desired tone and theme.
- **Player Expectations**: Players may have different expectations regarding monster player characters. Some may expect to have all the abilities of the monster, while others may be willing to accept limitations for the sake of game balance.
- **Group Dynamics**: The inclusion of a monster player character can affect the dynamics of the player group. The DM should consider whether the other players would be comfortable with a monster character in the group.

## Eligible Monsters

Not all monsters are suitable as player characters. The DM should consider the following factors when determining whether a monster is eligible:

- **Intelligence**: The monster should have sufficient intelligence to function as a player character. As a general rule, the monster should have an Intelligence score of at least 6.
- **Alignment**: The monster's alignment should be compatible with the campaign and the player group. Evil monsters may be problematic in a good-aligned campaign or group.
- **Size**: The monster's size should be manageable within the context of the campaign. Very large or very small monsters may face practical difficulties in many adventure scenarios.
- **Special Abilities**: The monster's special abilities should not be so powerful as to disrupt game balance. Monsters with abilities like level drain, petrification, or instant death effects may be problematic.

## Adjusting Monster Abilities

To maintain game balance, the DM may need to adjust the abilities of monster player characters:

- **Hit Dice**: The monster's hit dice may need to be adjusted to be comparable to those of standard player characters of the same level.
- **Special Abilities**: The monster's special abilities may need to be limited or modified to prevent them from being overpowered.
- **Level Advancement**: The monster may need a different experience point progression for level advancement, reflecting their inherent advantages or disadvantages.
- **Class Restrictions**: The monster may be restricted in the classes they can choose, or they may be limited to advancing as a monster rather than taking class levels.

## Example Monster Player Characters

Here are some examples of how common monsters might be adjusted for use as player characters:

- **Orc**: Orcs are similar to the half-orc player character race, but with slightly different ability score adjustments and racial abilities. They might be treated as half-orcs with a -1 penalty to Intelligence and Charisma.
- **Goblin**: Goblins are small humanoids with darkvision and a bonus to Dexterity. They might be treated as a variant of the halfling race, with darkvision instead of the halfling's saving throw bonuses.
- **Lizard Man**: Lizard men are reptilian humanoids with natural armor and swimming ability. They might be treated as a new player character race with a +1 bonus to Strength, a -1 penalty to Intelligence, natural armor equivalent to leather, and the ability to swim at their full movement rate.

## Role-Playing Monster Characters

Playing a monster character presents unique role-playing challenges and opportunities:

- **Cultural Differences**: Monsters have their own cultures, values, and perspectives, which may differ significantly from those of the standard player character races. Players should consider how these differences would affect their character's behavior and interactions.
- **Prejudice and Discrimination**: Monsters may face prejudice and discrimination from the standard races, particularly if the monster's kind is known for hostility or evil. Players should consider how their character would respond to such treatment.
- **Integration**: Monsters may struggle to integrate into society, facing practical difficulties in areas like finding accommodation, purchasing equipment, or interacting with NPCs. Players should consider how their character would handle these challenges.

## Conclusion

Monster player characters can add diversity and interest to a campaign, but they require careful consideration and adjustment to ensure they enhance rather than detract from the game experience. The DM should use these guidelines to handle monster player characters in a way that is balanced and enjoyable for all players.
