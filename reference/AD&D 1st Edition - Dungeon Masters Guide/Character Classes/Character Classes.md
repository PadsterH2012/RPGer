# Character Classes

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Character classes are the professions or vocations of player characters in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. Each class has its own unique abilities, requirements, and limitations, which define the character's role in the game. This section provides an overview of the character classes available in the game and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling class-related issues in the campaign.

## Available Classes

The following classes are available for player characters in the AD&D game:

### Fighter Classes

- **Fighter**: The basic warrior class, skilled in combat and able to use all types of weapons and armor.
- **Paladin**: A specialized fighter who serves the cause of law and good, with special abilities such as detecting evil, immunity to disease, and the ability to cure by laying on hands.
- **Ranger**: A specialized fighter who is skilled in woodcraft, tracking, and combat against giant-class creatures, with special abilities such as the ability to move silently and hide in shadows in natural surroundings.

### Magic-User Classes

- **Magic-User**: The basic spellcaster class, able to cast arcane spells but limited in their choice of weapons and armor.
- **Illusionist**: A specialized magic-user who focuses on spells of illusion and deception, with a different spell list than the standard magic-user.

### Clerical Classes

- **Cleric**: The basic priest class, serving a deity and able to cast divine spells, with the ability to turn undead and restrictions on the use of edged weapons.
- **Druid**: A specialized cleric who serves the forces of nature, with a different spell list than the standard cleric and special abilities such as the ability to identify plants and animals and immunity to charm spells cast by woodland creatures.

### Thief Classes

- **Thief**: The basic rogue class, skilled in stealth, picking locks, finding and removing traps, and other similar activities.
- **Assassin**: A specialized thief who focuses on killing for hire, with special abilities such as disguise and the use of poison.

### Other Classes

- **Monk**: A specialized class combining elements of the fighter and thief classes, with special abilities such as stunning attacks, increased movement rate, and resistance to certain attacks.
- **Bard**: A specialized class combining elements of the fighter, thief, and druid classes, with special abilities such as charm, legend lore, and the ability to inspire allies.

## Class Requirements

Each class has specific requirements that a character must meet to be eligible for that class. These requirements typically include minimum ability scores and, in some cases, alignment restrictions. For example:

- **Fighter**: Requires a minimum Strength of 9.
- **Paladin**: Requires a minimum Strength of 12, Intelligence of 9, Wisdom of 13, Constitution of 9, and Charisma of 17, and must be Lawful Good.
- **Magic-User**: Requires a minimum Intelligence of 9.
- **Cleric**: Requires a minimum Wisdom of 9.
- **Thief**: Requires a minimum Dexterity of 9.

## Class Abilities and Limitations

Each class has its own unique abilities and limitations, which define the character's role in the game. These can include:

- **Combat Abilities**: Classes vary in their ability to fight effectively, with fighters being the most proficient and magic-users being the least.
- **Spell Abilities**: Some classes can cast spells, with magic-users and clerics being the primary spellcasting classes.
- **Special Abilities**: Many classes have special abilities, such as the paladin's ability to detect evil or the thief's ability to pick locks.
- **Weapon and Armor Restrictions**: Classes vary in the types of weapons and armor they can use, with fighters having the fewest restrictions and magic-users having the most.
- **Advancement Rates**: Classes vary in how quickly they advance in level, with thieves advancing the most quickly and paladins advancing the most slowly.

## Multi-Class and Dual-Class Characters

In addition to single-class characters, the AD&D game allows for multi-class and dual-class characters:

- **Multi-Class Characters**: Non-human characters can be multi-class, meaning they advance in two or three classes simultaneously. They gain the abilities and limitations of all their classes, but they advance more slowly in each class than a single-class character.
- **Dual-Class Characters**: Human characters can be dual-class, meaning they start in one class and later switch to another. They cannot use the abilities of their original class while advancing in their new class, until they exceed the level they reached in their original class.

## Class Balance

The DM should strive to maintain balance between the different classes, ensuring that no class is significantly more powerful or less powerful than the others. This can be achieved through:

- **Consistent Application of Rules**: The DM should apply the rules for class abilities and limitations consistently for all players.
- **Appropriate Challenges**: The DM should design adventures that provide appropriate challenges for all classes, allowing each class to use its unique abilities.
- **Fair Distribution of Rewards**: The DM should ensure that magical items and other rewards are distributed fairly, with consideration for the needs and abilities of each class.

## Conclusion

Character classes are a fundamental aspect of the AD&D game, defining the roles and abilities of player characters. The DM should ensure that the rules for class abilities and limitations are applied consistently and fairly, and should design adventures that provide appropriate challenges and rewards for all classes.
