# Assassination Experience Points

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Assassins in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game can earn experience points through successful assassinations, in addition to the normal methods of earning experience points. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on awarding experience points for assassinations.

## Assassination as a Profession

Assassination is the primary profession of the assassin class. Assassins are trained to kill targets efficiently and discreetly, often for payment. The following aspects of assassination should be considered:

- **Contracts**: Assassins typically receive contracts to kill specific targets. These contracts may come from individuals, organizations, or governments, and they typically include payment for successful completion.
- **Difficulty**: The difficulty of an assassination depends on various factors, including the target's level or hit dice, the target's defenses and protections, and the circumstances of the assassination.
- **Methods**: Assassins may use various methods to kill their targets, including direct combat, poison, traps, or disguise and deception.
- **Consequences**: Failed assassination attempts can have serious consequences, including retaliation from the target, legal prosecution, or damage to the assassin's reputation.

## Experience Points for Assassination

Assassins earn experience points for successful assassinations based on the difficulty of the assassination. The following guidelines apply:

- **Base Experience Points**: The base experience points for an assassination are determined by the target's level or hit dice, using the same table as for defeating monsters in combat.
- **Difficulty Modifiers**: The base experience points are modified based on the difficulty of the assassination. Factors that can increase the difficulty (and thus the experience points) include the target's defenses and protections, the presence of guards or allies, and the requirement for the assassination to appear accidental or natural.
- **Success Requirement**: To earn experience points for an assassination, the assassin must personally kill the target or directly cause the target's death. If the target is killed by others, the assassin does not earn the assassination experience points.
- **Failure Consequences**: If an assassination attempt fails, the assassin does not earn the assassination experience points. In addition, the DM may impose other consequences, such as retaliation from the target, legal prosecution, or damage to the assassin's reputation.

## Calculating Assassination Experience Points

The DM should calculate assassination experience points as follows:

1. **Determine Base Experience Points**: Look up the target's level or hit dice on the experience point table to determine the base experience points.
2. **Apply Difficulty Modifiers**: Modify the base experience points based on the difficulty of the assassination. The following modifiers are suggested:
   - **Target's Defenses**: +10% for each significant defensive measure, such as magical protections, high armor class, or special resistances.
   - **Guards or Allies**: +10% for each guard or ally who is protecting the target.
   - **Public Setting**: +20% if the assassination must be performed in a public setting with witnesses.
   - **Accidental or Natural Appearance**: +50% if the assassination must appear accidental or natural.
3. **Calculate Total Experience Points**: Add the base experience points and all modifiers to determine the total experience points for the assassination.

## Example Assassination Experience Points

Here are some examples of assassination experience points:

- **Level 5 Fighter with No Special Protections**: A level 5 fighter with no special protections might be worth 500 base experience points. If the fighter has two guards (+20%), the total experience points would be 600.
- **Level 10 Magic-User with Magical Protections**: A level 10 magic-user with several magical protections might be worth 2,000 base experience points. If the magic-user has magical protections (+30%), two apprentices as guards (+20%), and the assassination must appear natural (+50%), the total experience points would be 4,000.
- **King with Royal Guards and Palace Security**: A king (treated as a level 12 fighter) might be worth 3,000 base experience points. If the king has royal guards (+50%), palace security (+30%), magical protections (+30%), and the assassination must be performed in a public setting (+20%), the total experience points would be 6,900.

## Ethical Considerations

The assassination profession raises ethical considerations that the DM and players should address:

- **Alignment Restrictions**: The assassin class is restricted to evil alignments (Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, or Chaotic Evil). This reflects the inherently evil nature of the profession of killing for payment.
- **Campaign Tone**: The inclusion of assassins and assassination in a campaign can affect the tone of the campaign. The DM should consider whether this fits with the desired tone and theme of the campaign.
- **Player Comfort**: Some players may be uncomfortable with the concept of assassination. The DM should discuss this with the players and ensure that everyone is comfortable with the inclusion of this aspect of the game.

## Conclusion

Assassination experience points provide a unique way for assassin characters to advance in level, reflecting their specialized profession. The DM should use these guidelines to award experience points for assassinations in a way that is challenging but fair, and that enhances the game experience for the assassin player and the group as a whole.
