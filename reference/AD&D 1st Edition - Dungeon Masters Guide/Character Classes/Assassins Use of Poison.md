# Assassins Use of Poison

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Poison is a tool often employed by assassins in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game to eliminate their targets efficiently and discreetly. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling the use of poison by assassins in the campaign.

## Types of Poison

There are several types of poison that assassins may use:

- **Contact Poison**: This type of poison is absorbed through the skin. It can be applied to objects that the target is likely to touch, such as door handles, weapons, or clothing.
- **Ingested Poison**: This type of poison must be swallowed to take effect. It can be added to food or drink.
- **Inhaled Poison**: This type of poison is breathed in. It can be released as a gas or vapor in an enclosed space.
- **Injected Poison**: This type of poison must enter the bloodstream to take effect. It can be delivered via a poisoned weapon, such as a dagger or dart.

## Poison Effects

The effects of poison can vary widely, depending on the specific poison used:

- **Lethal Poison**: This type of poison is designed to kill the target. The target typically must make a saving throw versus poison, with failure resulting in death.
- **Debilitating Poison**: This type of poison is designed to weaken or incapacitate the target rather than kill them. Effects can include paralysis, unconsciousness, or ability score reductions.
- **Slow-Acting Poison**: This type of poison takes time to take effect, allowing the assassin to be far away when the target succumbs. The delay can range from hours to days, depending on the poison.
- **Undetectable Poison**: This type of poison is designed to be difficult to detect, either before or after it takes effect. It may be colorless, odorless, and tasteless, and it may mimic the symptoms of natural illness.

## Acquiring and Handling Poison

Assassins must acquire and handle poison carefully to avoid accidental exposure:

- **Acquisition**: Poison can be purchased from certain sources, such as thieves' guilds or black market dealers. It can also be extracted from certain plants, animals, or monsters. The DM should determine the availability and cost of poison based on the campaign setting.
- **Handling**: Handling poison is dangerous, with the risk of accidental exposure. The DM may require a Dexterity check or similar roll to handle poison safely, with failure resulting in exposure to the poison.
- **Storage**: Poison must be stored properly to maintain its potency and prevent accidental exposure. The DM may require special containers or precautions for storing poison.

## Using Poison

When an assassin uses poison, the DM should consider the following factors:

- **Application Method**: The method of applying the poison depends on the type of poison and the circumstances. Contact poison might be applied to an object, ingested poison might be added to food or drink, inhaled poison might be released in an enclosed space, and injected poison might be applied to a weapon.
- **Detection Risk**: There is a risk that the poison will be detected before it takes effect. The DM should determine this risk based on the nature of the poison, the method of application, and the awareness and precautions of the target.
- **Saving Throw**: The target is typically allowed a saving throw versus poison to resist the effects. The difficulty of this saving throw depends on the potency of the poison.
- **Effects**: If the target fails their saving throw, they suffer the effects of the poison. These effects depend on the specific poison used, as described above.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

The use of poison raises legal and ethical considerations that the DM and players should address:

- **Legal Status**: In most settings, the use of poison is illegal and severely punished. Assassins who are caught using poison may face execution or other harsh penalties.
- **Alignment Considerations**: The use of poison, particularly lethal poison, may be inconsistent with certain alignments. For example, a lawful character might have moral objections to the use of poison, viewing it as dishonorable or cowardly.
- **Campaign Tone**: The inclusion of poison use in a campaign can affect the tone of the campaign. The DM should consider whether this fits with the desired tone and theme of the campaign.
- **Player Comfort**: Some players may be uncomfortable with the concept of poison use. The DM should discuss this with the players and ensure that everyone is comfortable with the inclusion of this aspect of the game.

## Poison in Combat

While poison is most often used in assassination scenarios, it can also be used in direct combat:

- **Poisoned Weapons**: Assassins can apply poison to their weapons before combat. The poison takes effect if the weapon successfully hits and damages the target.
- **Poison Vials**: Assassins can throw vials of contact or inhaled poison at targets during combat. This typically requires an attack roll, with the poison taking effect if the vial breaks on or near the target.
- **Poison Resistance**: Some creatures are resistant or immune to poison. The DM should consider these resistances and immunities when determining the effects of poison.

## Conclusion

The use of poison adds depth to the assassin class, providing them with additional options for eliminating targets. The DM should use these guidelines to handle poison use in a way that is challenging but fair, and that enhances the game experience for the assassin player and the group as a whole.
