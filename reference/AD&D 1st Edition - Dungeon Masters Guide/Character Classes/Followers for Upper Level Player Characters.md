# Followers for Upper Level Player Characters

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

As player characters in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game reach higher levels, they may attract followers who serve them out of respect, fear, or the desire for protection or guidance. This section provides guidelines for determining the followers that upper-level player characters may attract.

## Types of Followers

There are several types of followers that upper-level player characters may attract:

- **Men-at-Arms**: These are ordinary soldiers or guards who serve the character. They may include light infantry, heavy infantry, archers, cavalry, or other types of troops.
- **Specialists**: These are skilled individuals who provide specific services to the character. They may include armorers, blacksmiths, engineers, sages, or other specialists.
- **Lower-Level Characters**: These are characters of the same class as the player character, but of lower level. They may serve as lieutenants, apprentices, or other subordinates.
- **Monsters**: Some classes, particularly rangers and druids, may attract monsters as followers. These may include animals, magical beasts, or other creatures.

## Attracting Followers

Followers are typically attracted to a character when the character reaches a certain level and establishes a stronghold or base of operations. The specific level and conditions vary by class:

- **Fighters**: Attract followers when they reach 9th level and establish a castle or stronghold.
- **Paladins**: Attract followers when they reach 9th level and establish a castle or stronghold.
- **Rangers**: Attract followers when they reach 10th level, but do not need to establish a stronghold.
- **Magic-Users**: Attract followers when they reach 12th level and establish a tower or stronghold.
- **Illusionists**: Attract followers when they reach 12th level and establish a tower or stronghold.
- **Clerics**: Attract followers when they reach 9th level and establish a temple or religious stronghold.
- **Druids**: Attract followers when they reach 12th level, but do not need to establish a stronghold.
- **Thieves**: Attract followers when they reach 10th level and establish a guild or stronghold.
- **Assassins**: Attract followers when they reach 12th level and establish a guild or stronghold.
- **Monks**: Attract followers when they reach 8th level and establish a monastery.
- **Bards**: Attract followers when they reach 12th level and establish a stronghold.

## Determining Followers

The specific followers attracted by a character are determined by rolling on tables specific to the character's class. These tables typically indicate the type and number of followers, as well as their level or hit dice.

The DM should roll on these tables when a character reaches the appropriate level and establishes a stronghold (if required). The followers typically arrive over a period of time, rather than all at once.

## Managing Followers

Followers are NPCs controlled by the DM, but they serve the player character. The following guidelines apply to the management of followers:

- **Loyalty**: Followers have a base loyalty determined by the character's Charisma and other factors. This loyalty can be increased by good treatment and decreased by poor treatment.
- **Payment**: Most followers expect payment for their services. The specific amount varies by the type of follower and the services provided.
- **Equipment**: The character is typically responsible for providing equipment for their followers, particularly for men-at-arms and lower-level characters of the same class.
- **Casualties**: Followers who are killed in service to the character may be replaced over time, but the character may develop a reputation for getting followers killed if casualties are excessive.
- **Advancement**: Lower-level characters who serve as followers may advance in level over time, particularly if they participate in adventures with the character.

## Special Cases

Some classes have special rules for followers:

- **Paladins**: Paladins attract particularly loyal and devoted followers, but they must maintain their lawful good alignment and adhere to their code of conduct to keep these followers.
- **Rangers**: Rangers attract animal or monster followers rather than human or demi-human followers.
- **Druids**: Druids attract animal or monster followers rather than human or demi-human followers.
- **Monks**: Monks attract followers who wish to learn the monk's discipline and way of life.

## Conclusion

Followers can add depth and complexity to the game for upper-level characters, providing them with resources, support, and responsibilities. The DM should use the rules for followers as guidelines, adapting them as necessary to suit the specific needs and preferences of the campaign.
