# Character Abilities

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Character abilities are the fundamental attributes that define a character's capabilities in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. These abilities represent the character's natural aptitudes and capabilities, and they have a significant impact on the character's performance in the game.

## The Six Ability Scores

There are six ability scores in the AD&D game:

- **Strength (STR)**: This ability measures the character's physical power, and it affects the character's ability to hit in combat, to cause damage, to force doors open, and to perform other feats of physical strength.
- **Intelligence (INT)**: This ability measures the character's mental acuity, and it affects the character's ability to learn and use knowledge, to understand languages, and to cast certain types of spells.
- **Wisdom (WIS)**: This ability measures the character's common sense and willpower, and it affects the character's ability to resist certain types of spells and other mental influences, and to cast certain types of spells.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: This ability measures the character's agility and hand-eye coordination, and it affects the character's ability to hit with missile weapons, to avoid being hit, and to perform tasks requiring manual dexterity.
- **Constitution (CON)**: This ability measures the character's physical stamina and health, and it affects the character's hit points, ability to survive resurrection, and resistance to certain types of spells and other physical effects.
- **Charisma (CHA)**: This ability measures the character's force of personality and leadership ability, and it affects the character's ability to influence others, to attract and retain followers, and to cast certain types of spells.

## Ability Score Range

Ability scores in the AD&D game typically range from 3 to 18, with 3 being the minimum and 18 being the maximum for most races. Some races have adjustments to certain ability scores, which can result in scores below 3 or above 18. For example, a Dwarf receives a +1 bonus to Constitution and a -1 penalty to Charisma.

In addition, certain magical effects, such as wishes or magical items, can increase ability scores beyond 18. For fighters (including rangers and paladins), Strength can be increased to 18/01-18/00 (exceptional Strength) and beyond.

## Ability Score Modifiers

Each ability score provides modifiers that affect various aspects of the game. The specific modifiers vary by ability score and by the specific aspect of the game being affected. For example:

- **Strength**: Provides modifiers to hit, damage, weight allowance, and other strength-related activities.
- **Intelligence**: Provides modifiers to the number of languages known, the ability to learn spells, and other intelligence-related activities.
- **Wisdom**: Provides modifiers to saving throws against certain types of spells and other wisdom-related activities.
- **Dexterity**: Provides modifiers to armor class, initiative, and other dexterity-related activities.
- **Constitution**: Provides modifiers to hit points, system shock survival, and other constitution-related activities.
- **Charisma**: Provides modifiers to reaction adjustments, loyalty base, and other charisma-related activities.

## Changing Ability Scores

Ability scores can change during the course of the game due to various factors:

- **Aging**: As characters age, their physical abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) typically decrease, while their mental abilities (Intelligence, Wisdom) typically increase.
- **Magical Effects**: Certain magical effects, such as wishes, magical items, or spells, can increase or decrease ability scores.
- **Disease and Injury**: Certain diseases or injuries can temporarily or permanently decrease ability scores.
- **Training and Experience**: In some campaigns, the DM may allow characters to increase their ability scores through training and experience.

## Conclusion

Character abilities are a fundamental aspect of the AD&D game, defining the character's natural aptitudes and capabilities. The DM should ensure that ability scores are generated fairly and consistently, and should apply the appropriate modifiers based on the character's ability scores. The DM should also track changes to ability scores due to aging, magical effects, disease, injury, and other factors.
