This section provides a detailed explanation of each of the six ability scores in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, including their effects on various aspects of the game.

## Strength (STR)

Strength measures the character's physical power, muscle, and stamina. It is particularly important for fighters and other characters who engage in physical combat.

### Effects of Strength

### Exceptional Strength

Fighters (including rangers and paladins) with a Strength score of 18 may roll percentile dice to determine their exceptional Strength, which can range from 01 to 00 (treated as 100).
