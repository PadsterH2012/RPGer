# Traps

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Traps in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are hazardous devices or mechanisms designed to harm, hinder, or capture characters who trigger them. This section provides detailed information on traps and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on creating, placing, and adjudicating these dangerous elements in the campaign.

## Purpose of Traps

Traps serve several important purposes in the game:

- **Challenge**: Traps provide challenges that test players' caution, perception, and problem-solving abilities rather than their combat skills.
- **Resource Depletion**: Traps can deplete character resources such as hit points, spells, and equipment, adding to the overall challenge of an adventure.
- **Pacing**: Traps can slow characters' progress, creating tension and preventing them from moving too quickly through dangerous areas.
- **Protection**: Traps logically protect valuable treasures, important locations, or significant NPCs, adding realism to the game world.
- **Atmosphere**: Traps contribute to the atmosphere of danger and mystery in dungeons and other hazardous environments.

## Types of Traps

There are several categories of traps in the AD&D game:

- **Mechanical Traps**: Physical devices that trigger harmful effects, such as pit traps, arrow traps, or crushing walls.
- **Magical Traps**: Traps that use magical effects to harm or hinder characters, such as glyphs of warding, symbol spells, or magical teleporters.
- **Combination Traps**: Traps that combine mechanical and magical elements, such as a pit trap with a magical illusion covering it.
- **Alarm Traps**: Traps designed primarily to alert guardians rather than directly harm intruders, such as bells, gongs, or magical alarms.
- **Capture Traps**: Traps designed to capture rather than kill, such as net traps, cage traps, or paralysis gas.

## Common Trap Elements

Most traps include the following elements:

- **Trigger**: The action or condition that activates the trap, such as stepping on a pressure plate, opening a door, or moving an object.
- **Mechanism**: The physical or magical components that make the trap function, such as springs, levers, or enchantments.
- **Effect**: The harmful or hindering result of the trap, such as falling, being struck by projectiles, or being affected by a spell.
- **Reset**: Whether and how the trap resets after being triggered, such as automatically, manually, or not at all.
- **Detection Difficulty**: How difficult the trap is to detect before triggering it, typically expressed as a percentage chance for thieves' find traps ability or as descriptive guidance for other detection methods.
- **Disarming Difficulty**: How difficult the trap is to disarm once detected, typically expressed as a percentage chance for thieves' remove traps ability or as descriptive guidance for other disarming methods.

## Specific Trap Examples

The following are examples of common traps:

### Pit Traps

- **Simple Pit**: A concealed hole in the floor, typically 10-30 feet deep, causing falling damage (1d6 per 10 feet).
- **Spiked Pit**: A pit with spikes at the bottom, causing additional damage (typically 1d6 for spikes) and possible infection.
- **Locking Pit**: A pit with a mechanism that locks or seals after a character falls in, preventing easy escape.
- **Flooding Pit**: A pit that begins to fill with water, acid, or other liquid after being triggered.
- **Chute Pit**: A pit with a sloped bottom that deposits characters in a different area of the dungeon.

### Projectile Traps

- **Arrow Trap**: Fires one or more arrows at characters who trigger it, typically requiring an attack roll against the character's AC.
- **Dart Trap**: Similar to an arrow trap but using smaller projectiles, often poisoned.
- **Spear Trap**: Fires larger projectiles causing more damage, or multiple spears to affect a wider area.
- **Falling Block Trap**: Drops a heavy block or ceiling section on characters, typically affecting an area rather than a single target.
- **Rolling Boulder Trap**: Releases a boulder or similar object that rolls along a corridor, potentially affecting multiple characters.

### Gas Traps

- **Poison Gas Trap**: Releases a cloud of poisonous gas, requiring saving throws to avoid damage or death.
- **Sleep Gas Trap**: Releases gas that causes unconsciousness, requiring saving throws to resist.
- **Blinding Gas Trap**: Releases gas that temporarily blinds characters, imposing penalties on attacks and other actions.
- **Confusion Gas Trap**: Releases gas that causes confusion, making characters act unpredictably.
- **Alarm Gas Trap**: Releases a distinctive-smelling or colored gas that alerts nearby guardians.

### Magical Traps

- **Glyph of Warding**: A magical inscription that triggers a harmful spell effect when disturbed.
- **Symbol**: A more powerful version of a glyph, causing effects such as death, fear, or insanity.
- **Teleportation Trap**: Magically transports characters to another location, potentially separating the party or placing them in danger.
- **Polymorph Trap**: Transforms characters into different creatures, typically requiring a saving throw to resist.
- **Curse Trap**: Places a curse on characters, causing ongoing negative effects until removed.

### Combination Traps

- **False Floor Over Pit**: A mechanical pit trap concealed by a magical illusion.
- **Trapped Chest with Multiple Hazards**: A chest with both mechanical traps (poison needles, blades) and magical traps (glyphs, curses).
- **Trapped Door with Alarm**: A door with a mechanical trap that harms intruders and a magical alarm that alerts guardians.
- **Flooding Room with Locked Exits**: A room that begins to flood when entered, with exits that magically lock.
- **Animated Statue with Gas**: A statue that animates to attack while simultaneously releasing harmful gas.

## Trap Placement

The DM should consider the following factors when placing traps:

- **Logical Locations**: Traps should be placed in locations where they make logical sense, such as protecting valuable treasures, important areas, or secret passages.
- **Builder Intent**: Traps should reflect the intent and capabilities of those who built them, with different types of traps for different builders (dwarves, wizards, cultists, etc.).
- **Age and Condition**: Older traps may be less reliable, partially disabled, or show signs of their presence due to deterioration.
- **Warning Signs**: Some traps may have warning signs intended to deter intruders, while others may be deliberately disguised to appear harmless.
- **Frequency**: Traps should be used sparingly enough to maintain their surprise and impact, rather than becoming predictable or tedious.

## Detecting Traps

Characters can detect traps through various means:

- **Thief Abilities**: Thieves have a specific find traps ability, with a percentage chance of success based on their level.
- **Careful Observation**: Any character can attempt to detect traps through careful observation and investigation, with the DM determining the likelihood of success based on the trap's nature and the character's approach.
- **Magical Detection**: Spells such as find traps, detect magic, or true seeing can reveal the presence of traps, particularly magical ones.
- **Probing and Testing**: Characters can probe suspicious areas with tools or expendable items, such as using a pole to test for pressure plates or throwing objects to trigger potential traps.
- **NPC or Monster Knowledge**: Captured or friendly NPCs or monsters may provide information about traps in their territory.

## Disarming Traps

Once detected, characters may attempt to disarm traps:

- **Thief Abilities**: Thieves have a specific remove traps ability, with a percentage chance of success based on their level.
- **Mechanical Solutions**: Characters may devise mechanical solutions to disarm traps, such as wedging pressure plates, tying off triggers, or blocking moving parts.
- **Magical Solutions**: Spells such as dispel magic, knock, or telekinesis may be used to disarm traps safely.
- **Triggering from Safety**: Characters may trigger traps from a safe distance or position, using poles, ropes, or expendable items.
- **Bypassing**: Rather than disarming a trap, characters may find ways to bypass it entirely, such as flying over a pit trap or using dimension door to pass through a trapped area.

## Trap Consequences

When traps are triggered, various consequences may occur:

- **Damage**: Many traps cause physical damage to characters, requiring hit point loss and possibly saving throws to reduce or avoid damage.
- **Status Effects**: Some traps cause status effects such as paralysis, blindness, or confusion, imposing penalties or limitations on affected characters.
- **Separation**: Some traps separate characters, such as teleportation traps or traps that seal off portions of the dungeon.
- **Resource Depletion**: Even when not directly harmful, traps may force characters to expend resources such as healing spells, potions, or special equipment.
- **Alerting Enemies**: Some traps alert nearby enemies to the characters' presence, potentially leading to encounters with prepared opponents.

## Creating Original Traps

The DM should consider the following factors when creating original traps:

- **Creativity**: Original traps should be creative and interesting, providing memorable challenges rather than routine obstacles.
- **Fairness**: Traps should be fair, with reasonable chances of detection and disarming, and consequences that are significant but not automatically lethal.
- **Clues**: Most traps should have some form of clue or warning that observant players might notice, rewarding careful play.
- **Multiple Solutions**: Well-designed traps often have multiple potential solutions, allowing for creative problem-solving.
- **Integration**: Traps should be integrated into the dungeon environment and story, rather than appearing as isolated or arbitrary hazards.

## Adjudicating Traps

The DM should consider the following factors when adjudicating traps in play:

- **Consistency**: Trap mechanics should be applied consistently, establishing precedents that players can learn from and apply to future situations.
- **Player Skill vs. Character Skill**: The DM should balance the role of player skill (clever ideas, careful play) and character skill (ability scores, class abilities) in dealing with traps.
- **Description Quality**: The DM should provide clear and evocative descriptions of traps and their effects, creating tension and excitement rather than frustration.
- **Timing and Pacing**: The DM should manage the timing and pacing of trap encounters, ensuring they add to the adventure's excitement without bogging down play.
- **Learning Opportunities**: Failed trap encounters should provide learning opportunities for players, with enough survivors or clues to inform future approaches.

## Conclusion

Traps are a classic and important element of the AD&D game, providing challenges that test players' caution, perception, and problem-solving abilities while adding to the atmosphere of danger and mystery in dungeons and other hazardous environments. The DM should use traps thoughtfully to enhance adventures, considering their purpose, placement, detection, and consequences. By understanding the different types of traps and their role in the game, the DM can create engaging and challenging trap encounters that contribute to memorable and exciting adventures.
