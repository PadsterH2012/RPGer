# Tricks

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Tricks in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are puzzling, deceptive, or unusual features designed to confuse, mislead, or challenge characters without necessarily causing direct harm. This section provides detailed information on tricks and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on creating, placing, and adjudicating these intriguing elements in the campaign.

## Purpose of Tricks

Tricks serve several important purposes in the game:

- **Mental Challenge**: Tricks provide mental challenges that test players' problem-solving abilities, creativity, and deductive reasoning rather than their combat skills or character statistics.
- **Pacing Variation**: Tricks add variety to dungeon exploration, breaking up the pattern of combat encounters and treasure finds with different types of challenges.
- **Player Engagement**: Tricks engage players directly, often requiring player ingenuity rather than character abilities to overcome.
- **World Building**: Tricks can reveal aspects of the dungeon's creators, history, or purpose, adding depth to the game world.
- **Access Control**: Tricks can control access to important areas or treasures, requiring specific solutions rather than brute force to proceed.

## Types of Tricks

There are several categories of tricks in the AD&D game:

- **Puzzles**: Challenges that require solving a logical or pattern-based problem, such as riddles, mathematical puzzles, or pattern recognition tasks.
- **Illusions**: Deceptive sensory effects that mislead characters about the nature of their environment, such as illusory doors, floors, or monsters.
- **Magical Effects**: Unusual magical phenomena that create strange or unexpected situations, such as reversed gravity, time distortion, or magical transformations.
- **Mechanical Devices**: Unusual mechanisms or contraptions that require specific interactions to operate or bypass, such as complex locks, moving platforms, or hidden levers.
- **Deceptive Architecture**: Architectural features designed to confuse or mislead, such as rotating rooms, one-way passages, or optical illusions.

## Common Trick Elements

Most tricks include the following elements:

- **Presentation**: How the trick appears or is presented to the characters, including its physical appearance, sensory cues, or initial effects.
- **Mechanism**: The underlying principle or mechanism that makes the trick work, whether magical, mechanical, or psychological.
- **Challenge**: The specific challenge or problem posed by the trick that characters must overcome.
- **Solution**: The method or methods by which the trick can be solved, bypassed, or neutralized.
- **Consequence**: The result of successfully solving the trick or failing to do so, including rewards, penalties, or changes to the environment.

## Specific Trick Examples

- **Forced Perspective**: Architecture designed to create optical illusions about size, distance, or direction.

## Trick Placement

The DM should consider the following factors when placing tricks:

- **Logical Locations**: Tricks should be placed in locations where they make logical sense, such as protecting valuable treasures, important areas, or secret knowledge.
- **Builder Intent**: Tricks should reflect the intent and capabilities of those who created them, with different types of tricks for different creators (wizards, priests, ancient civilizations, etc.).
- **Thematic Consistency**: Tricks should be consistent with the overall theme and atmosphere of the dungeon or adventure.
- **Frequency and Variety**: Tricks should be used in moderation and with variety, avoiding repetition that might become predictable or tedious.
- **Integration**: Tricks should be integrated into the dungeon environment and story, rather than appearing as isolated or arbitrary challenges.

## Solving Tricks

Characters can attempt to solve tricks through various means:

- **Observation**: Careful observation may reveal clues about the nature of a trick and how to solve it.
- **Experimentation**: Cautious experimentation with different approaches or interactions may reveal the solution to a trick.
- **Knowledge and Intelligence**: Character knowledge, particularly in areas such as history, arcana, or religion, may provide insights into tricks based on specific traditions or principles.
- **Magical Investigation**: Spells such as detect magic, identify, or true seeing may reveal the magical nature or properties of tricks.
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: Many tricks require creative problem-solving by the players, using the information and resources available to devise solutions.

## Trick Consequences

Successfully solving or failing to solve tricks can have various consequences:

- **Access**: Many tricks control access to new areas, treasures, or information, with successful solutions granting access and failures preventing it.
- **Rewards**: Some tricks provide direct rewards for successful solutions, such as treasure, magical benefits, or useful information.
- **Penalties**: Some tricks impose penalties for incorrect solutions or interactions, ranging from minor inconveniences to significant dangers.
- **Transformation**: Some tricks transform the environment or the characters themselves when solved or triggered.
- **Knowledge**: Even tricks without direct rewards or penalties may provide knowledge or insights that prove valuable later in the adventure.

## Creating Original Tricks

The DM should consider the following factors when creating original tricks:

- **Creativity**: Original tricks should be creative and interesting, providing memorable challenges rather than routine obstacles.
- **Fairness**: Tricks should be fair, with sufficient clues for players to reasonably deduce solutions without requiring specific knowledge they couldn't possess.
- **Multiple Solutions**: Well-designed tricks often have multiple potential solutions, allowing for creative problem-solving.
- **Clarity**: While tricks should be challenging, the nature of the challenge should be clear enough that players understand what they're trying to accomplish.
- **Relevance**: Tricks should be relevant to the adventure's themes, story, or setting, rather than appearing as arbitrary puzzles.

## Adjudicating Tricks

The DM should consider the following factors when adjudicating tricks in play:

- **Player vs. Character Knowledge**: The DM should distinguish between player knowledge and character knowledge, particularly for puzzles that rely on player reasoning.
- **Hint Provision**: When players are stuck, the DM may provide hints through character observations, skill checks, or NPC assistance, rather than allowing the game to stall.
- **Flexibility**: The DM should be flexible in accepting reasonable solutions that players devise, even if they differ from the intended solution.
- **Timing and Pacing**: The DM should manage the timing and pacing of trick encounters, ensuring they add to the adventure's interest without causing frustration or excessive delays.
- **Description Quality**: The DM should provide clear and evocative descriptions of tricks, ensuring players have the information they need to engage with the challenge.

## Conclusion

Tricks are a distinctive and engaging element of the AD&D game, providing mental challenges that test players' problem-solving abilities and creativity while adding variety and depth to dungeon exploration. The DM should use tricks thoughtfully to enhance adventures, considering their purpose, placement, solution methods, and consequences. By understanding the different types of tricks and their role in the game, the DM can create intriguing and satisfying trick encounters that contribute to memorable and intellectually stimulating adventures.
