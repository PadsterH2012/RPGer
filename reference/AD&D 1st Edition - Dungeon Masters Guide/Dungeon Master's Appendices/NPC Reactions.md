# NPC Reactions

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

NPC (Non-Player Character) reactions in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game determine how NPCs initially respond to encounters with player characters. This section provides detailed information on NPC reactions and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on determining and role-playing these responses.

## Purpose of Reaction Rolls

Reaction rolls serve several important purposes in the game:

- **Impartiality**: They provide an impartial method for determining NPC attitudes, reducing DM bias and creating unpredictability.
- **Encounter Variety**: They create variety in encounters, preventing all NPCs of a particular type from behaving identically.
- **Player Influence**: They allow player actions, particularly those of charismatic characters, to influence NPC behavior.
- **Role-Playing Guidance**: They provide guidance for the DM's role-playing of NPCs, suggesting initial attitudes that can evolve through interaction.
- **Encounter Direction**: They help determine the initial direction of an encounter, whether toward combat, negotiation, cooperation, or other interactions.

## The Reaction Roll System

The basic reaction roll system works as follows:

1. **When to Roll**: Make a reaction roll when characters first encounter an NPC or group of NPCs whose reaction is not predetermined by the adventure or obvious from the circumstances.
2. **Basic Roll**: Roll 2d10 to determine the initial reaction.
3. **Apply Modifiers**: Apply modifiers based on Charisma, circumstances, and other factors.
4. **Interpret Result**: Consult the Reaction Table to determine the NPC's initial attitude and likely behavior.
5. **Role-Play Accordingly**: Role-play the NPC based on this initial reaction, allowing it to evolve through interaction.

## The Reaction Table

The standard reaction table uses 2d10 to determine initial reactions:

| 2d10 Roll | Reaction                                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 2         | Immediate attack                                        |
| 3-5       | Hostile, possible attack                                |
| 6-8       | Uncertain, cautious                                     |
| 9-11      | Neutral, uninterested                                   |
| 12-18     | Friendly, helpful                                       |
| 19-20     | Enthusiastic, loyal                                     |

## Reaction Modifiers

Various factors can modify the reaction roll:

- **Charisma**: The Charisma of the character leading the interaction provides a modifier to the reaction roll, as shown in the following table:

| Charisma | Reaction Adjustment |
|----------|---------------------|
| 3        | -5                  |
| 4-5      | -3                  |
| 6-8      | -1                  |
| 9-12     | 0                   |
| 13-15    | +1                  |
| 16-17    | +2                  |
| 18       | +3                  |

- **Racial Attitudes**: Some races have natural affinities or antipathies toward others, providing bonuses or penalties to reaction rolls. For example:
  - Dwarves and elves may have penalties when interacting with each other.
  - Halflings may have bonuses when interacting with humans.
  - Orcs may have penalties when interacting with elves or dwarves.

- **Alignment**: Alignment differences can affect reactions, with greater differences typically resulting in penalties to reaction rolls.

- **Prior Interactions**: Previous interactions between the parties can significantly affect reactions, with positive past experiences providing bonuses and negative past experiences providing penalties.

- **Gifts or Offerings**: Appropriate gifts or offerings can improve reactions, with the bonus depending on the value and appropriateness of the gift.

- **Approach Method**: How the player characters approach the encounter can affect reactions, with respectful or cautious approaches typically providing bonuses and aggressive or disrespectful approaches providing penalties.

- **Specific Circumstances**: Various specific circumstances can affect reactions, such as territorial intrusion, resource competition, or common threats.

## Interpreting Reaction Results

The DM should interpret reaction results based on the specific circumstances:

- **Immediate Attack**: The NPCs attack without hesitation or negotiation, seeking to defeat or drive away the player characters.

- **Hostile, Possible Attack**: The NPCs are hostile and may attack if they feel threatened or see an advantage, but might be willing to parley or be intimidated into withdrawal.

- **Uncertain, Cautious**: The NPCs are wary and uncertain, neither immediately hostile nor friendly. They may ask questions, make demands, or take defensive positions while assessing the situation.

- **Neutral, Uninterested**: The NPCs are neither hostile nor particularly friendly. They may ignore the player characters if possible, or interact minimally if necessary.

- **Friendly, Helpful**: The NPCs are positively disposed toward the player characters and may offer information, assistance, or cooperation, within reasonable limits.

- **Enthusiastic, Loyal**: The NPCs are extremely well-disposed toward the player characters and may offer significant assistance, join them temporarily, or form lasting alliances.

## Reaction and Intelligence

The intelligence of NPCs affects how reactions are determined and interpreted:

- **Non-Intelligent Creatures**: Creatures with animal-level intelligence or lower typically react based on instinct rather than reason. Their reactions are more predictable and less influenced by factors such as Charisma or negotiation attempts.

- **Semi-Intelligent Creatures**: Creatures with limited intelligence can understand basic concepts and may be influenced by obvious displays of strength, submission, or offering of food, but are less responsive to complex negotiation or subtle social cues.

- **Intelligent Creatures**: Creatures with human-level intelligence or higher can understand complex situations, be influenced by reasoned arguments or appeals to self-interest, and may have sophisticated motivations that affect their reactions.

- **Highly Intelligent Creatures**: Creatures with exceptional intelligence may see through deception, anticipate consequences, or have complex plans that influence their reactions in ways that may not be immediately apparent.

## Changing Reactions

Reactions can change during an encounter based on various factors:

- **Player Character Actions**: The actions of player characters can significantly affect reactions, with respectful, helpful, or impressive actions improving reactions and disrespectful, threatening, or incompetent actions worsening them.

- **Communication**: Effective communication can improve reactions, while poor communication or misunderstandings can worsen them. Language barriers can make communication difficult and may affect reactions negatively.

- **Negotiation**: Successful negotiation can improve reactions, particularly if the player characters can identify and address the concerns or desires of the NPCs.

- **Changing Circumstances**: Changes in the circumstances of the encounter, such as the arrival of new participants, the discovery of common enemies, or changes in the environment, can affect reactions.

- **Time Passage**: As an encounter progresses, initial reactions may shift based on extended interaction, observation of behavior, or simply the passage of time allowing for better assessment.

## Special Reaction Situations

Certain special situations require specific handling of reactions:

- **Mixed Groups**: When encountering mixed groups of NPCs, the DM may need to make separate reaction rolls for different individuals or subgroups, particularly if they have different motivations or attitudes.

- **Leaders and Followers**: In hierarchical groups, the reaction of the leader often determines the group's overall reaction, though individual followers may have different personal reactions.

- **Hidden Agendas**: Some NPCs may have hidden agendas that affect their true reactions, causing them to display a false reaction initially while planning something different.

- **Cultural Factors**: Cultural differences between the player characters and NPCs may affect reactions, with certain behaviors being considered respectful in one culture but offensive in another.

- **Status and Reputation**: The status or reputation of the player characters may affect reactions, with famous or high-status characters potentially receiving different reactions than unknown or low-status ones.

## Using Reaction Rolls in Play

The DM should consider the following factors when using reaction rolls in play:

- **When to Roll**: Not every NPC encounter requires a reaction roll. Predetermined reactions based on the adventure, logical responses based on the situation, or consistent characterization of recurring NPCs may supersede random determination.

- **Visible Modifiers**: The DM should make players aware of obvious modifiers to reaction rolls, such as those based on Charisma or racial attitudes, so they can make informed decisions about who should lead interactions.

- **Hidden Modifiers**: Some modifiers, particularly those based on hidden agendas or information unknown to the players, should be applied secretly by the DM.

- **Consistency**: Reaction rolls should be used consistently to maintain fairness and player trust, rather than being selectively applied only when convenient for the DM's plans.

- **Role-Playing Integration**: Reaction rolls should guide role-playing rather than replace it, providing an initial attitude that is then expressed and developed through actual interaction.

## Conclusion

NPC reactions are a crucial element of the AD&D game, determining how the inhabitants of the game world initially respond to the player characters and setting the tone for subsequent interactions. The DM should use the reaction system to create diverse and realistic encounters that respond to player actions and decisions, while also reflecting the nature and motivations of the NPCs involved. By understanding the factors that affect reactions and interpreting results in a way that is consistent with the specific circumstances, the DM can create more dynamic and engaging encounters that reward player skill and role-playing.
