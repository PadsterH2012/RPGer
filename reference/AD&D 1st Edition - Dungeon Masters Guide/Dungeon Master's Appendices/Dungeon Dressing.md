# Dungeon Dressing

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Dungeon dressing in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game refers to the details, furnishings, and atmospheric elements that bring dungeon environments to life beyond their basic architectural features. This section provides detailed information on dungeon dressing and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on creating immersive and interesting dungeon environments.

## Purpose of Dungeon Dressing

Dungeon dressing serves several important purposes in the game:

- **Atmosphere**: Dressing creates atmosphere and mood, making dungeons feel like real, lived-in (or abandoned) environments rather than empty rooms and corridors.
- **Verisimilitude**: Dressing adds verisimilitude, making dungeons more believable by including the details one would expect to find in their particular type and history.
- **Information**: Dressing can provide information about the dungeon's creators, inhabitants, purpose, or history through environmental storytelling.
- **Interaction Opportunities**: Dressing provides objects and features for characters to interact with beyond combat and basic exploration.
- **Concealment**: Dressing can conceal important elements such as traps, secret doors, or treasures, rewarding thorough investigation.

## Types of Dungeon Dressing

There are several categories of dungeon dressing:

- **Furnishings**: Furniture and functional objects that would be used by dungeon inhabitants, such as tables, chairs, beds, and storage containers.
- **Decorations**: Ornamental elements that enhance the appearance of the dungeon, such as tapestries, statues, paintings, or mosaics.
- **Structural Details**: Minor architectural features that add character to the basic structure, such as columns, alcoves, niches, or architectural styles.
- **Remains**: Evidence of previous inhabitants or activities, such as bones, corpses, abandoned equipment, or signs of conflict.
- **Natural Features**: Elements of nature that have intruded into the dungeon, such as plant growth, water features, or animal nests.
- **Sensory Details**: Non-visual elements that enhance the sensory experience, such as sounds, smells, air quality, or temperature variations.
