# Creating NPCs

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are all the characters controlled by the Dungeon Master (DM) rather than by players. This section provides detailed information on creating NPCs and guidance for the DM on developing and role-playing these essential elements of the campaign.

## Types of NPCs

There are several categories of NPCs in the AD&D game:

- **Major NPCs**: Significant characters with detailed backgrounds, personalities, and statistics, such as rulers, villains, mentors, or recurring allies.
- **Minor NPCs**: Less detailed characters who play supporting roles, such as shopkeepers, guards, or informants.
- **Henchmen**: NPCs who are directly employed by and loyal to player characters, often accompanying them on adventures.
- **Hirelings**: NPCs who work for player characters in a more limited capacity, typically providing specific services for wages.
- **Followers**: NPCs who are attracted to high-level characters when they establish strongholds or achieve name level.
- **Monsters as NPCs**: Intelligent monsters who are developed as characters rather than simply combat encounters.

## Creating Major NPCs

Major NPCs should be developed in detail, considering the following elements:

### Basic Characteristics

- **Race and Class**: Determine the NPC's race and class (if any), considering what would be appropriate for their role in the campaign.
- **Level**: Determine the NPC's level, typically based on their importance, age, and role. Important NPCs are often higher level than the player characters.
- **Ability Scores**: Generate ability scores using one of the character generation methods, adjusting as appropriate for the NPC's role and importance.
- **Alignment**: Determine the NPC's alignment, considering their background, culture, and role in the campaign.
- **Physical Characteristics**: Develop distinctive physical characteristics, including age, appearance, and any notable features.

### Background and Personality

- **Personal History**: Create a brief history for the NPC, including significant events that shaped them.
- **Motivations**: Determine what drives the NPC, including their goals, desires, and fears.
- **Personality Traits**: Develop distinctive personality traits that will make the NPC memorable and guide their behavior.
- **Quirks and Mannerisms**: Add specific quirks or mannerisms that make the NPC distinctive and recognizable.
- **Relationships**: Establish the NPC's relationships with other characters, organizations, or factions in the campaign.

### Game Statistics

- **Combat Statistics**: Determine the NPC's hit points, armor class, saving throws, and attack bonuses.
- **Special Abilities**: Note any special abilities from the NPC's class, race, or unique background.
- **Equipment**: Provide appropriate equipment, including weapons, armor, and magical items if applicable.
- **Wealth**: Determine the NPC's wealth and resources, considering their position and background.
- **Spells**: For spellcasting NPCs, select appropriate spells known or prepared.

## Creating Minor NPCs

Minor NPCs require less detail but should still be distinctive:

- **Essential Characteristics**: Provide only the characteristics necessary for the NPC's role, such as basic statistics, relevant skills, and key personality traits.
- **Distinctive Element**: Give each minor NPC at least one distinctive element to make them memorable, such as a physical feature, speech pattern, or unusual habit.
- **Simplified Statistics**: Use simplified statistics for minor NPCs, focusing on the aspects most likely to be relevant to player interaction.
- **Group Templates**: Create templates for groups of similar NPCs, such as city guards or cultists, with minor variations for individuals.
- **Improvisation Framework**: Prepare a framework that allows for easy improvisation of additional details if the NPC becomes more important than initially expected.

## Henchmen and Hirelings

Henchmen and hirelings have special considerations:

### Henchmen

- **Loyalty**: Henchmen have a loyalty score, typically based on the employer's Charisma and treatment of the henchman, which affects their reliability and dedication.
- **Advancement**: Henchmen gain experience and advance in level, typically at a slower rate than player characters.
- **Compensation**: Henchmen typically receive a share of treasure (often half or quarter share) in addition to basic maintenance.
- **Personality**: Henchmen should have developed personalities and may have their own goals and motivations beyond serving their employer.
- **Limit**: Characters are typically limited in the number of henchmen they can have based on their Charisma score.

### Hirelings

- **Specific Services**: Hirelings provide specific services rather than general adventuring support, such as porters, guides, or specialists.
- **Wages**: Hirelings receive set wages rather than a share of treasure, with rates varying by the type of service and skill level.
- **Limited Loyalty**: Hirelings have limited loyalty and will typically flee from serious danger unless exceptionally well-paid or treated.
- **Term of Service**: Hirelings typically serve for a specific term or until a particular task is completed.
- **Specialist Skills**: Some hirelings have specialist skills, such as blacksmiths, sages, or engineers, with corresponding higher wages.

## Followers

Followers are attracted to high-level characters who establish strongholds:

- **Class Dependence**: The type and number of followers depend on the character's class, with fighters attracting men-at-arms, clerics attracting acolytes, etc.
- **Quality Variation**: The quality of followers varies, with most being relatively low-level but with occasional higher-level individuals.
- **Management**: Followers require management and leadership, with morale affected by how they are treated and led.
- **Development**: Significant followers can be developed as more detailed NPCs if they become important to the campaign.
- **Replacement**: Followers who are lost may be replaced over time, though exceptional followers may be irreplaceable.

## Role-Playing NPCs

Effective role-playing of NPCs involves several considerations:

- **Distinctive Voice**: Use distinctive voices, speech patterns, or verbal tics to differentiate NPCs during play.
- **Consistent Behavior**: Ensure that NPC behavior is consistent with their established personality, motivations, and alignment.
- **Appropriate Knowledge**: Consider what the NPC would reasonably know based on their background, intelligence, and position.
- **Realistic Reactions**: Have NPCs react realistically to player character actions, based on their own interests and perspectives.
- **Development Over Time**: Allow NPCs to change and develop over time in response to events and interactions with player characters.

## NPCs and the Campaign

NPCs serve various functions in the campaign:

- **Plot Advancement**: NPCs can provide information, assignments, or assistance that advances the campaign plot.
- **World Building**: NPCs help bring the campaign world to life, representing its cultures, factions, and power structures.
- **Moral Complexity**: NPCs with complex motivations and alignments can create moral dilemmas and difficult choices for players.
- **Recurring Characters**: Recurring NPCs create continuity and emotional investment in the campaign.
- **Foils and Contrasts**: NPCs can serve as foils or contrasts to player characters, highlighting their qualities or challenging their perspectives.

## Conclusion

Non-Player Characters are essential elements of the AD&D game, providing the social context, challenges, assistance, and opposition that make the campaign world feel alive and dynamic. The DM should develop NPCs with appropriate detail for their role in the campaign, focusing on creating distinctive and memorable characters who act according to their own motivations and perspectives. By understanding the different types of NPCs and their functions in the game, the DM can create a rich and engaging campaign populated by characters who enhance the players' experience and contribute to the overall narrative.
