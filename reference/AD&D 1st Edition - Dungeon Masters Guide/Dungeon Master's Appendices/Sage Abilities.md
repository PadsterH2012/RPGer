Sages in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are specialized non-player characters (NPCs) who possess extensive knowledge in particular fields of study.

## Consulting a Sage

The process of consulting a sage typically involves the following steps:

1. **Finding a Sage**: Characters must first locate a sage with the appropriate expertise, which may involve research, asking around in academic or urban centers, or consulting with institutions of learning.

2. **Availability**: Sages are relatively rare, and those with expertise in obscure fields may be even rarer. The DM determines whether an appropriate sage is available in the current location or if travel is required.

3. **Formulating Questions**: Characters must formulate specific questions within the sage's field of expertise. Vague or overly broad questions are less likely to receive useful answers.

4. **Negotiating Terms**: Characters must negotiate the sage's fee and timeframe. Fees typically range from 100-1,000 gold pieces per question, depending on the difficulty, obscurity, and time required for research.

5. **Research Time**: The sage requires time to research answers, typically 1d4 days for simple questions in their major fields, 1d6 days for complex questions in major fields or simple questions in minor fields, and 2d6 days or more for very obscure questions or those outside their primary expertise.

6. **Receiving Answers**: After the research period, the sage provides answers based on their knowledge and research success. The accuracy and completeness of these answers depend on various factors, as determined by the DM.

## Determining Sage Answers

When a sage attempts to answer a question, the DM determines the result based on several factors:

1. **Base Chance**: Establish a base chance of the sage knowing the answer, typically:
   - 90% for questions in a major field
   - 70% for questions in a minor field
   - 50% for questions in a related field
   - 30% or less for questions outside the sage's expertise

2. **Modifying Factors**: Adjust this base chance based on:
   - Question Difficulty: -10% to -30% for particularly obscure or specialized questions
   - Research Resources: +10% to +20% if the sage has access to exceptional libraries or collections
   - Research Time: +5% per additional day spent beyond the normal research period
   - Previous Research: +10% to +20% if the sage has previously researched similar questions
   - Character Assistance: +5% to +15% if characters with relevant knowledge assist the research

3. **Determine Result**: Roll percentile dice against the modified chance to determine the result:
   - Success: The sage provides accurate and complete information
   - Partial Success (within 10% of the target): The sage provides mostly accurate information with minor errors or omissions
   - Failure: The sage cannot provide a definitive answer or provides significantly flawed information

4. **Special Results**: On a natural roll of 01-05, the sage may provide exceptional insight beyond what was asked. On a natural roll of 96-00, the sage may provide confidently stated but completely incorrect information.

## Sage Personalities and Characteristics

Sages should be developed as distinctive NPCs with individual personalities:

- **Physical Characteristics**: Sages often (but not always) fit the stereotype of elderly, scholarly individuals, perhaps with distinctive features related to their field of study.

- **Personality Traits**: Sages may exhibit various personality traits, such as:
  - Absentmindedness or intense focus
  - Enthusiasm for sharing knowledge or jealous guarding of secrets
  - Practical approach to knowledge or purely theoretical interest
  - Desire for recognition or preference for anonymity
  - Willingness to travel or reluctance to leave their studies

- **Motivations**: Sages may be motivated by:
  - Pure intellectual curiosity
  - Desire for academic recognition
  - Financial needs or greed
  - Service to a particular institution or deity
  - Personal quest for specific knowledge

- **Quirks**: Distinctive quirks can make sages memorable, such as:
  - Unusual speech patterns or vocabulary
  - Collecting specific objects related to their field
  - Peculiar dietary habits or daily routines
  - Superstitious practices or rituals
  - Unusual pets or companions

## Sages in the Campaign

Sages can serve various roles in the campaign:

- **Information Sources**: Sages provide information that characters cannot reasonably be expected to know, helping to advance plots or solve mysteries.

- **Quest Givers**: Sages may hire characters to retrieve rare books, specimens, or artifacts needed for their research.

- **Mentors**: Sages can serve as mentors to characters with scholarly interests, providing guidance, training, or access to resources.

- **Rivals**: Sages competing for the same knowledge or recognition may become rivals to character-allied sages or to scholarly characters themselves.

- **Adventure Hooks**: A sage's unusual discovery, disappearance, or request for assistance can serve as a hook for new adventures.

## Conclusion

Sages are valuable NPCs in the AD&D game, providing specialized knowledge that can help characters understand the world, solve problems, and advance their goals. The DM should develop sages as distinctive individuals with specific areas of expertise, personalities, and roles in the campaign. By understanding the nature and abilities of sages, the DM can use these learned individuals to enhance the depth and richness of the campaign world while providing useful resources for the player characters.
