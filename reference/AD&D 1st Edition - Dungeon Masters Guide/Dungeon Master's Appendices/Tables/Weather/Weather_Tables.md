| d20 Roll | Temperature Variation                                    |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Two categories colder                                    |
| 2-3      | One category colder                                      |
| 4-14     | Normal for season and climate                            |
| 15-18    | One category warmer                                      |
| 19-20    | Two categories warmer                                    |

**Table Notes:**
- Base temperature is determined by climate type and season
- Daily variations can shift temperature to adjacent categories
- Temperature affects travel rate, water consumption, and combat
- Protection from extreme temperatures includes appropriate clothing, shelter, or magic
- Temperature may vary by time of day (typically cooler at night, warmer at midday)

**Table Notes:**
- Special weather phenomena are rare (5% chance per week)
- Effects should be appropriate to the climate and terrain
- Magical weather may be tied to local magical sites or events
- Severe weather can cause damage to structures and terrain
- Special weather may herald the arrival of unusual monsters or events
