# Wilderness Encounter Tables

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Wilderness encounter tables in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game provide a systematic method for determining random encounters in various outdoor environments. This section provides detailed information on wilderness encounter tables and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on using them effectively.

## Purpose of Wilderness Encounter Tables

Wilderness encounter tables serve several important purposes:

- **Environmental Diversity**: They reflect the diverse environments of the campaign world, with different creatures inhabiting different terrain types.
- **Travel Challenge**: They add challenge and unpredictability to wilderness travel, making journeys between settlements or dungeons meaningful parts of the adventure.
- **Resource Management**: They test the party's resource management during extended journeys, as multiple encounters may deplete spells, hit points, and supplies.
- **World Building**: They help build a living world where characters encounter the inhabitants and hazards of different regions.
- **Adventure Hooks**: They can provide unexpected adventure hooks through random encounters that develop into more significant interactions or quests.

## Using Wilderness Encounter Tables

The DM should follow these general procedures when using wilderness encounter tables:

1. **Encounter Check**: Make an encounter check at appropriate intervals, typically once per day and once per night of travel. The base chance is typically 1 in 10 (roll of 1 on 1d10).
2. **Terrain Determination**: Determine the specific terrain type the party is traveling through, such as forest, mountains, desert, etc.
3. **Encounter Type**: Roll on the appropriate terrain table to determine the type of creature encountered.
4. **Encounter Details**: Determine the number of creatures, their distance from the party, and their initial reaction.
5. **Encounter Resolution**: Resolve the encounter through role-playing, combat, evasion, or other means as appropriate.

## Factors Affecting Wilderness Encounters

Several factors can affect wilderness encounters:

- **Party Size**: Larger parties may attract more attention, potentially increasing the frequency of encounters or the number of creatures encountered.
- **Party Noise**: Noisy parties (those in metal armor, using light sources at night, or making no effort to move quietly) may have an increased chance of encounters.
- **Party Precautions**: Parties taking precautions such as posting guards, using camouflage, or traveling stealthily may have a reduced chance of encounters or increased chance of spotting creatures before being spotted.
- **Time of Day**: Different creatures may be active at different times, with nocturnal creatures more common at night and diurnal creatures more common during the day.
- **Weather Conditions**: Extreme weather may reduce the chance of encounters or limit the types of creatures active.

## Wilderness Terrain Types

The following are the primary terrain types for wilderness encounters:

- **Plain**: Open, relatively flat grasslands with few trees or major features.
- **Scrub/Brush**: Areas of low, woody vegetation, often transitional between plains and forests.
- **Forest**: Areas dominated by trees, from light woods to dense, primeval forests.
- **Hills**: Elevated terrain with significant slopes but not as steep or high as mountains.
- **Mountains**: High, rugged terrain with steep slopes, cliffs, and potentially extreme conditions.
- **Desert**: Arid regions with little vegetation, including sandy, rocky, or salt deserts.
- **Swamp/Marsh**: Wetlands with standing water and specialized vegetation.
- **Jungle**: Dense, tropical forests with abundant vegetation and diverse wildlife.
- **Ocean**: Open sea areas, potentially including encounters on, above, or below the water.
- **River/Lake**: Freshwater environments, including the water itself and shorelines.
- **Arctic/Tundra**: Cold regions with permafrost, limited vegetation, and specialized wildlife.
