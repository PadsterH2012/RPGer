### Table Extraction Approach
For each topic containing significant tables:
1. Create a Tables subdirectory within the relevant section directory
2. Create a comprehensive table file (e.g., "Topic_Tables.md") containing all related tables
3. Use standardized table formatting for consistency and readability
4. Add references to the table file in the main content file
5. Ensure tables are formatted to be readable by both humans and AI agents
