# Alignment Language

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, each alignment has its own secret language, known as an alignment language. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling alignment languages in the campaign.

## Nature of Alignment Languages

Alignment languages are not full languages in the sense of Common, Elvish, or other racial or regional languages. Instead, they are systems of passwords, hand signals, gestures, and hidden meanings that allow creatures of the same alignment to recognize each other and communicate basic concepts related to their shared moral and ethical outlook.

The following characteristics apply to alignment languages:

- **Limited Vocabulary**: Alignment languages have a limited vocabulary, focused on concepts relevant to the alignment. For example, the Lawful Good alignment language might have terms for honor, duty, and protection, while the Chaotic Evil alignment language might have terms for destruction, domination, and cruelty.
- **Non-Verbal Components**: Alignment languages include non-verbal components such as hand signals, gestures, and body language. These components can be used to communicate silently or to convey nuances that are difficult to express verbally.
- **Hidden Meanings**: Alignment languages often use common words with hidden or double meanings, allowing creatures of the same alignment to communicate secretly even in the presence of others.
- **Recognition Signals**: Alignment languages include recognition signals that allow creatures of the same alignment to identify each other. These signals might be verbal passwords, specific gestures, or patterns of behavior.

## Learning Alignment Languages

Characters automatically know the alignment language corresponding to their alignment. The following rules apply to learning alignment languages:

- **Restriction**: Characters can only know the alignment language corresponding to their current alignment. They cannot learn alignment languages of other alignments.
- **Changing Alignment**: If a character changes alignment, they forget their old alignment language and learn their new one. This change is automatic and immediate.
- **Multiple Alignments**: Characters with multiple alignments (such as dual-aligned creatures) know the alignment languages of all their alignments.

## Using Alignment Languages

Alignment languages can be used in various ways in the campaign:

- **Recognition**: Creatures can use alignment languages to recognize others of the same alignment. This can be useful for identifying potential allies or enemies.
- **Secret Communication**: Creatures can use alignment languages to communicate secretly, even in the presence of others. This can be useful for planning actions or sharing information that should not be known to others.
- **Expressing Alignment Concepts**: Creatures can use alignment languages to express concepts that are difficult to convey in other languages. For example, a Lawful Good creature might use their alignment language to express a complex concept of honor that has no direct equivalent in Common.

## Detecting Alignment Languages

Alignment languages are designed to be difficult to detect and understand by those who do not know them. The following guidelines apply:

- **Observation**: Characters who observe others using an alignment language might notice that communication is taking place, but they cannot understand the content unless they know the alignment language.
- **Magical Detection**: Spells such as comprehend languages do not allow a character to understand alignment languages they do not know. However, spells such as know alignment can reveal a creature's alignment, which might provide context for understanding their use of an alignment language.
- **Deception**: Characters might attempt to fake knowledge of an alignment language to deceive others. The DM should determine the success of such attempts based on the character's knowledge, the complexity of the deception, and the perceptiveness of the target.

## Alignment Languages and Monsters

Monsters and other non-player characters (NPCs) know the alignment language corresponding to their alignment, just as player characters do. The following guidelines apply:

- **Intelligent Monsters**: Monsters with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher can use alignment languages effectively.
- **Less Intelligent Monsters**: Monsters with an Intelligence score of 3-5 have a limited understanding and use of alignment languages.
- **Unintelligent Monsters**: Monsters with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower do not use alignment languages.

## Alignment Languages in the Campaign

The DM should consider the role of alignment languages in the campaign:

- **Importance**: The DM should decide how important alignment languages are in the campaign. In some campaigns, they may be a significant element of communication and recognition. In others, they may be a minor background element.
- **Detail**: The DM should decide how much detail to provide about alignment languages. Some DMs may develop specific vocabularies, gestures, and recognition signals for each alignment language. Others may handle them more abstractly.
- **Player Knowledge**: The DM should decide how much knowledge players have about alignment languages other than their own. In some campaigns, players may have general knowledge about the nature and use of all alignment languages. In others, they may only know about their own alignment language.

## Conclusion

Alignment languages add depth to the alignment system in the AD&D game, providing a means for creatures of the same alignment to recognize each other and communicate their shared moral and ethical outlook. The DM should use alignment languages as a tool to enhance the role-playing experience, not as a rigid set of rules to constrain player creativity.
