# Changing Alignment

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, a character's alignment can change during the course of a campaign, either voluntarily or involuntarily. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling alignment changes in the campaign.

## Reasons for Alignment Change

There are several reasons why a character's alignment might change:

- **Character Development**: As a character develops and grows, their moral and ethical outlook may evolve, leading to a change in alignment. This is the most natural and role-playing-intensive reason for alignment change.
- **Magical Effects**: Certain magical effects, such as a helm of opposite alignment or certain cursed items, can force a character to change alignment.
- **Divine Intervention**: Deities or other powerful beings may cause a character to change alignment as a reward, punishment, or test.
- **Persistent Behavior**: If a character consistently behaves in a manner contrary to their stated alignment, the DM may determine that their alignment has changed to match their behavior.

## Voluntary Alignment Change

A character may choose to change alignment based on a change in their beliefs or values. The following guidelines apply:

- **Role-Playing**: A voluntary alignment change should be role-played, with the character demonstrating a shift in their moral and ethical outlook over time.
- **Significant Development**: A voluntary alignment change should reflect a significant development in the character's story, not a casual or arbitrary decision.
- **DM Approval**: The DM should approve voluntary alignment changes, ensuring that they are consistent with the character's development and the campaign's tone.

## Involuntary Alignment Change

A character may be forced to change alignment due to magical effects or other external forces. The following guidelines apply:

- **Magical Effects**: Certain magical effects, such as a helm of opposite alignment, can force a character to change alignment. The specific effect determines the new alignment and the duration of the change.
- **Saving Throws**: Characters may be allowed saving throws to resist involuntary alignment changes, depending on the nature of the effect.
- **Role-Playing**: Even involuntary alignment changes should be role-played, with the character demonstrating the shift in their moral and ethical outlook.

## Consequences of Alignment Change

Alignment changes can have various consequences for a character:

- **Class Restrictions**: Some character classes have alignment restrictions. If a character changes to an alignment not allowed for their class, they may lose class abilities or be required to change classes.
- **Deity Relationships**: A character's relationship with their deity may be affected by an alignment change. If the new alignment is incompatible with the deity's ethos, the character may lose divine favor or be required to seek a new deity.
- **Magic Item Compatibility**: Some magic items are alignment-specific. If a character changes to an incompatible alignment, they may be unable to use these items or may suffer negative effects from them.
- **Social Relationships**: A character's relationships with other characters, both player characters and non-player characters, may be affected by an alignment change. Friends may become enemies, and enemies may become friends.
- **Alignment Language**: A character who changes alignment forgets their old alignment language and learns their new one.

## Handling Alignment Change in the Campaign

The DM should consider the following factors when handling alignment changes in the campaign:

- **Gradual Change**: Alignment changes, particularly voluntary ones, should typically be gradual rather than sudden. A character might shift from Lawful Good to Neutral Good, then to True Neutral, rather than jumping directly from Lawful Good to Chaotic Evil.
- **Consistency**: The DM should ensure that alignment changes are consistent with the character's development and the campaign's tone. Arbitrary or capricious alignment changes can disrupt the narrative and reduce the significance of alignment as a character trait.
- **Player Agency**: The DM should respect player agency in alignment changes. While the DM has the authority to determine that a character's alignment has changed based on their behavior, this should be done in consultation with the player and with clear communication about the reasons for the change.
- **Campaign Impact**: The DM should consider the impact of alignment changes on the campaign. Significant alignment changes, particularly for key characters, can alter the dynamics of the campaign and may require adjustments to planned adventures or storylines.

## Detecting Alignment Change

Several methods exist for detecting a character's alignment change:

- **Spells**: Spells such as know alignment can reveal a character's current alignment, potentially revealing a change.
- **Magical Items**: Certain magical items, such as a helm of opposite alignment, can detect or affect alignment.
- **Special Abilities**: Some creatures or character classes have the ability to detect alignment. For example, paladins can detect evil.
- **Behavior**: Changes in a character's behavior may indicate an alignment change, though this is not always reliable as characters may act contrary to their alignment for various reasons.

## Reversing Alignment Change

In some cases, an alignment change may be reversed:

- **Voluntary Reversal**: A character who voluntarily changed alignment may choose to return to their original alignment, following the same guidelines as for any voluntary alignment change.
- **Magical Reversal**: Certain magical effects, such as remove curse or wish, may be able to reverse an involuntary alignment change caused by magical effects.
- **Divine Intervention**: Deities or other powerful beings may reverse an alignment change as a reward or in response to the character's actions.

## Conclusion

Alignment changes add depth and dynamism to characters in the AD&D game, allowing for character development and responding to significant events in the campaign. The DM should handle alignment changes in a way that enhances the role-playing experience and maintains the significance of alignment as a character trait.
