# Alignment

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Alignment is a fundamental aspect of character and creature definition in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. It represents a character's basic moral and ethical outlook, influencing their behavior, decisions, and interactions with others. This section provides an overview of the alignment system and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling alignment in the campaign.

## The Alignment System

The AD&D alignment system is based on two axes: law versus chaos and good versus evil. This creates a grid of nine possible alignments:

- **Lawful Good**: Characters who believe in order, honor, and the protection of the innocent. They follow rules and laws, but place the welfare of others above all else.
- **Neutral Good**: Characters who believe in doing good without particular concern for order or chaos. They do what is necessary to bring about the most good.
- **Chaotic Good**: Characters who believe in freedom, individuality, and doing good. They follow their conscience and help others, but chafe at rules and regulations.
- **Lawful Neutral**: Characters who believe in order and organization above all else. They follow rules and laws without particular concern for whether they bring about good or evil.
- **True Neutral**: Characters who believe in the balance between all forces. They act to preserve the balance, or they simply have no strong inclination toward any alignment.
- **Chaotic Neutral**: Characters who believe in freedom and individuality above all else. They follow their whims and desires without particular concern for whether they bring about good or evil.
- **Lawful Evil**: Characters who believe in using order and organization to advance their own interests, regardless of the harm caused to others. They follow rules and laws when it suits them, but have no compunction about harming others to get what they want.
- **Neutral Evil**: Characters who believe in doing whatever they can get away with to advance their own interests, without particular concern for order or chaos. They do what is necessary to bring about the most benefit for themselves.
- **Chaotic Evil**: Characters who believe in freedom to pursue their own interests, regardless of the harm caused to others. They follow their whims and desires, and take pleasure in causing harm to others.

## Alignment and Behavior

A character's alignment should influence their behavior, decisions, and interactions with others. The following guidelines apply:

- **Consistency**: A character's behavior should be generally consistent with their alignment. While occasional deviations are possible, persistent behavior contrary to alignment may indicate a need for an alignment change.
- **Interpretation**: Alignment is a general guideline, not a straitjacket. Different characters of the same alignment may interpret and express that alignment in different ways.
- **Complexity**: Alignment is a simplification of complex moral and ethical positions. Characters may have nuanced views that don't perfectly fit any single alignment.

## Alignment and Classes

Some character classes have alignment restrictions:

- **Paladin**: Must be Lawful Good.
- **Ranger**: Must be Good (any).
- **Druid**: Must be True Neutral.
- **Monk**: Must be Lawful (any).
- **Bard**: Must be Neutral (any).
- **Assassin**: Must be Evil (any).

These restrictions reflect the fundamental nature and ethos of these classes. A character who changes to an alignment not allowed for their class may lose class abilities or be required to change classes.

## Alignment and Races

Different races may have tendencies toward certain alignments, though individual members of a race can deviate from these tendencies:

- **Humans**: Can be of any alignment.
- **Dwarves**: Tend toward Lawful Good.
- **Elves**: Tend toward Chaotic Good.
- **Gnomes**: Tend toward Neutral Good.
- **Half-Elves**: Tend toward Chaotic Good.
- **Halflings**: Tend toward Lawful Good.
- **Half-Orcs**: Tend toward Chaotic Evil.

These tendencies reflect the general cultural and biological influences on members of these races, but they are not deterministic. Individual characters can have any alignment allowed by their class.

## Alignment Languages

Each alignment has its own secret language, known only to creatures of that alignment. These languages are not full languages in the sense of Common or Elvish, but rather systems of passwords, hand signals, and hidden meanings that allow creatures of the same alignment to recognize each other and communicate basic concepts.

Alignment languages cannot be learned by characters who are not of the corresponding alignment. If a character changes alignment, they forget their old alignment language and learn their new one.

## Detecting Alignment

Several methods exist for detecting a character's alignment:

- **Spells**: Spells such as know alignment can reveal a character's alignment.
- **Magical Items**: Certain magical items, such as a helm of opposite alignment, can detect or affect alignment.
- **Special Abilities**: Some creatures or character classes have the ability to detect alignment. For example, paladins can detect evil.

## Changing Alignment

Characters can change alignment during the course of a campaign, either voluntarily or involuntarily:

- **Voluntary Change**: A character may choose to change alignment based on a change in their beliefs or values. This should be role-played and should reflect a significant development in the character's story.
- **Involuntary Change**: A character may be forced to change alignment due to magical effects, such as a helm of opposite alignment, or due to persistent behavior contrary to their current alignment.

The consequences of an alignment change can include loss of class abilities, changes in relationships with other characters, and the need to learn a new alignment language.

## Alignment in the Campaign

The DM should consider the role of alignment in the campaign:

- **Importance**: The DM should decide how important alignment is in the campaign. In some campaigns, alignment may be a central theme, with clear distinctions between good and evil. In others, it may be more of a background element, with more nuanced moral and ethical questions.
- **Enforcement**: The DM should decide how strictly to enforce alignment. Some DMs may require strict adherence to alignment, while others may allow more flexibility.
- **Consequences**: The DM should decide the consequences of alignment violations. These can range from warnings to loss of class abilities to forced alignment changes.

## Conclusion

Alignment is a fundamental aspect of character and creature definition in the AD&D game, providing a framework for understanding and role-playing moral and ethical positions. The DM should use the alignment system as a tool to enhance the game experience, not as a rigid set of rules to constrain player creativity.
