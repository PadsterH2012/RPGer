# Campaign Design

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Overview

The campaign is the overall framework within which adventures take place. It encompasses the entire milieu created by the Dungeon Master (DM), including geography, history, politics, societies, economies, and conflicts. A well-designed campaign provides a rich, consistent backdrop for player characters to interact with, offering countless adventure possibilities.
