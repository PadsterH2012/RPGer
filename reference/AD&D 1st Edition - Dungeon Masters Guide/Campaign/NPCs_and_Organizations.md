# NPCs and Organizations

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Overview

Non-Player Characters (NPCs) and organizations are vital elements that bring a campaign world to life. They provide allies, adversaries, information sources, and motivation for player characters. Well-crafted NPCs and organizations create a sense of a living, breathing world that exists beyond the immediate adventures of the player characters.
