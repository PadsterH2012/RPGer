# Approaches to Playing Advanced Dungeons & Dragons

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

There are several approaches to playing ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. The approaches can be divided into four categories:

## The Military Approach

This approach views the game as a wargame, with the players acting as generals commanding their forces (the player characters and their henchmen, hirelings, and followers) in battle against the enemy (the monsters and non-player characters controlled by the DM). The players are concerned with tactics, strategy, and the achievement of victory through the application of force. The players view the game as a series of battles, with the goal being to defeat the enemy and to gain treasure and experience points.

This approach is often favored by players who have a background in wargaming, and who view the AD&D game as an extension of wargaming. The players are concerned with the combat aspects of the game, and they view the role-playing aspects as secondary to the combat aspects. The players are interested in the acquisition of magical items and other treasures which will make their characters more powerful in combat.

## The Roleplaying Approach

This approach views the game as an exercise in role-playing, with the players acting out the roles of their characters in a fantasy world. The players are concerned with the development of their characters as personalities, and with the interaction of their characters with the world in which they exist. The players view the game as a series of adventures, with the goal being to experience the adventures and to develop their characters.

This approach is often favored by players who have a background in theater or creative writing, and who view the AD&D game as an opportunity to exercise their creative abilities. The players are concerned with the role-playing aspects of the game, and they view the combat aspects as secondary to the role-playing aspects. The players are interested in the development of their characters as personalities, and in the interaction of their characters with the world in which they exist.

## The Game Approach

This approach views the game as a game, with the players acting as players in a game. The players are concerned with the rules of the game, and with the achievement of victory through the application of the rules. The players view the game as a series of challenges, with the goal being to overcome the challenges and to gain treasure and experience points.

This approach is often favored by players who have a background in games of all sorts, and who view the AD&D game as another game to be played and won. The players are concerned with the rules of the game, and they view the role-playing aspects as secondary to the rules aspects. The players are interested in the acquisition of magical items and other treasures which will make their characters more powerful in the game.

## The Storytelling Approach

This approach views the game as a story, with the players and the DM acting as co-authors of the story. The players are concerned with the development of the story, and with the achievement of a satisfying conclusion to the story. The players view the game as a series of episodes in a story, with the goal being to experience the story and to contribute to its development.

This approach is often favored by players who have a background in literature or creative writing, and who view the AD&D game as an opportunity to participate in the creation of a story. The players are concerned with the story aspects of the game, and they view the combat and rules aspects as secondary to the story aspects. The players are interested in the development of the story, and in the contribution of their characters to the story.

## The Balanced Approach

The best approach to playing ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a balanced approach, which combines elements of all four approaches. The players should be concerned with the combat aspects of the game, with the role-playing aspects of the game, with the rules of the game, and with the story aspects of the game. The players should view the game as a series of adventures, with the goal being to experience the adventures, to develop their characters, to overcome challenges, and to contribute to the development of a story.

This approach is often favored by players who have a background in a variety of activities, and who view the AD&D game as an opportunity to exercise a variety of skills and abilities. The players are concerned with all aspects of the game, and they view no single aspect as more important than the others. The players are interested in the development of their characters, in the interaction of their characters with the world in which they exist, in the acquisition of magical items and other treasures, and in the contribution of their characters to the development of a story.
