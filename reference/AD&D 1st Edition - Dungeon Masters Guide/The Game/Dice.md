# Dice

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

The game requires the use of dice to generate random numbers to resolve various game factors such as success or failure of actions, damage caused by weapons, and many other aspects of the game. The dice used in the AD&D game are not the common six-sided dice found in most board games. Instead, the game uses polyhedral dice with 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 sides.

## Types of Dice

The following dice are used in the AD&D game:

- **Four-sided die (d4)**: A tetrahedron with 4 triangular faces.
- **Six-sided die (d6)**: The common cubic die with 6 square faces.
- **Eight-sided die (d8)**: An octahedron with 8 triangular faces.
- **Ten-sided die (d10)**: A pentagonal trapezohedron with 10 faces.
- **Twelve-sided die (d12)**: A dodecahedron with 12 pentagonal faces.
- **Twenty-sided die (d20)**: An icosahedron with 20 triangular faces.

## Dice Notation

The game uses a shorthand notation to indicate which dice to roll and how many. The notation consists of a number indicating how many dice to roll, followed by the letter "d" and a number indicating how many sides the dice have. For example:

- **1d4**: Roll one four-sided die.
- **2d6**: Roll two six-sided dice and add the results.
- **3d8**: Roll three eight-sided dice and add the results.
- **1d100** or **d%**: Roll two ten-sided dice, using one as the tens digit and one as the ones digit, to generate a number from 1 to 100. A roll of 00 is treated as 100.

## Using Dice in the Game

Dice are used in the AD&D game to resolve various game factors, including:

- **Character Generation**: Dice are used to determine a character's ability scores, hit points, and other characteristics.
- **Combat**: Dice are used to determine if an attack hits, how much damage is caused, and other combat factors.
- **Saving Throws**: Dice are used to determine if a character successfully resists the effects of spells, poisons, and other hazards.
- **Skill Checks**: Dice are used to determine if a character successfully uses a skill or ability.
- **Random Encounters**: Dice are used to determine if an encounter occurs, what type of encounter it is, and other factors related to the encounter.
- **Treasure**: Dice are used to determine what treasure is found, how much of it there is, and other factors related to treasure.

## Dice Rolling Techniques

The DM should establish a consistent method for rolling dice to ensure fairness and to prevent cheating. The following techniques are recommended:

- **Open Rolls**: The dice are rolled in full view of all players, and the results are accepted as rolled.
- **Hidden Rolls**: The DM rolls the dice behind a screen or otherwise out of view of the players, and announces the results. This technique is often used for rolls that the characters would not be aware of, such as checks for secret doors or hidden traps.
- **Player Rolls**: The players roll the dice for their characters' actions, and the DM rolls the dice for non-player characters and monsters.

The DM should establish which technique will be used for which types of rolls, and should be consistent in applying these techniques.
