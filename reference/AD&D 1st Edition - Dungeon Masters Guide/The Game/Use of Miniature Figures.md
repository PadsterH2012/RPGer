# Use of Miniature Figures

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

The use of miniature figures with ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is strongly recommended. Miniature figures offer a visual representation of the characters and creatures in the game, and they can be used to show marching order, combat positions, and other spatial relationships.

## Types of Miniature Figures

There are several types of miniature figures which can be used with the AD&D game:

- **Lead Figures**: These are traditional metal miniatures, usually made of a lead alloy. They are durable and can be painted to represent specific characters and creatures.
- **Plastic Figures**: These are less expensive than lead figures, but they are also less durable. They can be painted, but the paint tends to chip more easily than on lead figures.
- **Paper Figures**: These are the least expensive option, and they can be created by the players and the DM. They are not as durable as lead or plastic figures, but they are easy to create and can be customized to represent specific characters and creatures.

## Scale of Miniature Figures

The scale of miniature figures is important, as it determines how they relate to each other and to the playing surface. The most common scales for miniature figures used with the AD&D game are:

- **25mm Scale**: In this scale, a 6-foot-tall human figure is represented by a miniature figure that is 25mm tall. This is the most common scale for fantasy miniature figures.
- **15mm Scale**: In this scale, a 6-foot-tall human figure is represented by a miniature figure that is 15mm tall. This scale is less common for fantasy miniature figures, but it allows for more figures to be used in a given space.

## Using Miniature Figures in the Game

Miniature figures can be used in the AD&D game in several ways:

- **Marching Order**: Miniature figures can be used to show the order in which characters are moving through a dungeon or other environment. This is particularly useful for determining which characters are affected by traps, which characters can see what, and which characters are in position to respond to threats.
- **Combat Positions**: Miniature figures can be used to show the positions of characters and creatures during combat. This is particularly useful for determining which characters can attack which creatures, which characters are within range of spells and other effects, and which characters are in danger.
- **Visual Representation**: Miniature figures can be used to provide a visual representation of the characters and creatures in the game. This can help players to visualize the game world and to understand the relationships between characters and creatures.

## Playing Surface

Miniature figures are most effectively used with a playing surface that represents the environment in which the characters are operating. The playing surface can be as simple as a sheet of paper with a grid drawn on it, or as complex as a three-dimensional model of a dungeon or other environment.

The most common playing surface for use with miniature figures is a grid of 1-inch squares, with each square representing 10 feet in the game world. This scale is convenient for use with 25mm miniature figures, as a 25mm figure fits comfortably within a 1-inch square.

## Conclusion

The use of miniature figures with the AD&D game is strongly recommended, as they provide a visual representation of the game world and help to clarify spatial relationships. The DM and players should choose the type and scale of miniature figures that best suit their needs and preferences, and should use them in a way that enhances the game experience.
