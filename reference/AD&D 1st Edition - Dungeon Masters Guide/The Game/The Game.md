# The Game

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is a game of role-playing which relies upon the imagination of participants, for it is certainly make-believe, yet it is so interesting, so challenging, so mind-unleashing that it comes near reality. As a role-playing game, it allows participants to become other personae and to experience adventures and challenges which they cannot actually experience in real life.

The game is a framework around which you build your own fantasy world. It is not a novel or a short story, for it has no plot or predetermined outcome. It is not a wargame in the strict sense of the word, for it has no winners or losers. It is not a board game, for there is no set playing surface, and it is not limited by the bounds of a board. It is not a miniatures game, although miniature figures can be used to represent characters and creatures which inhabit your world.

The AD&D game is a complex game system, but it is not a complicated game. The rules which follow are comprehensive and designed to cover most situations which will arise during play. The game is based on a set of known factors, interpreted and applied by the DM. As the most important character in the AD&D game, the DM is expected to be the final arbiter, a person capable of creating and presenting a world in which the players can interact, a person who is fair and consistent in adjudication, and a person who is imaginative and creative.

The AD&D game is, as the name states, a game. Because it is a game, certain rules must be followed. The game is a combination of reality and fantasy, and the rules are designed to allow for the fantasy while maintaining a sense of reality. The rules are designed to be comprehensive, but they are not designed to be restrictive. The DM is encouraged to use imagination and creativity in the application of the rules, and to make judgments based on reason and logic when the rules do not specifically cover a situation.

The game is designed to be fun, and the rules are designed to make it so. The rules are not designed to be restrictive, but rather to provide a framework around which the DM can build a world of adventure and excitement. The rules are designed to be comprehensive, but they are not designed to cover every possible situation which might arise during play. The DM is expected to use reason and logic in the application of the rules, and to make judgments based on the spirit of the rules rather than the letter of the rules.

The AD&D game is a game of imagination, of role-playing, of adventure, and of excitement. It is a game which allows participants to become other personae and to experience adventures and challenges which they cannot actually experience in real life. It is a game which allows participants to use their imagination and creativity to the fullest, and which rewards those who do so.
