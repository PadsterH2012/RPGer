## Conclusion

Player character racial tendencies provide a framework for understanding the different races in the AD&D game, but they should not be used to restrict player creativity or to stereotype characters. Individual characters can deviate from these tendencies based on their personal experiences, beliefs, and choices. The DM should use these tendencies as guidelines, adapting them as necessary to suit the specific needs and preferences of the campaign.
