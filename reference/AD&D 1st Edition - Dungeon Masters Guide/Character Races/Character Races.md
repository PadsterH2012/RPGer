# Character Races

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

The ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game features a variety of character races, each with its own unique characteristics, abilities, and limitations. This section provides an overview of the character races available in the game and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling racial issues in the campaign.

## Available Races

The following races are available for player characters in the AD&D game:

- **Human**: Humans are the most common race in most campaign settings. They have no special abilities or limitations, but they can advance to unlimited levels in any class.
- **Dwarf**: Dwarves are short, stocky demi-humans known for their skill in mining, metalworking, and warfare. They have bonuses to Constitution and penalties to Charisma, and they have special abilities such as infravision and resistance to magic.
- **Elf**: Elves are slender, graceful demi-humans known for their love of nature, art, and magic. They have bonuses to Dexterity and penalties to Constitution, and they have special abilities such as infravision and resistance to charm spells.
- **Gnome**: Gnomes are small, clever demi-humans related to dwarves. They have bonuses to Intelligence and penalties to Wisdom, and they have special abilities such as infravision and the ability to speak with burrowing mammals.
- **Half-Elf**: Half-elves are the offspring of humans and elves. They combine some of the characteristics of both parent races, with no ability score adjustments but with some of the special abilities of elves.
- **Halfling**: Halflings are small, nimble demi-humans known for their comfort-loving nature and surprising resilience. They have bonuses to Dexterity and penalties to Strength, and they have special abilities such as resistance to magic and poison.
- **Half-Orc**: Half-orcs are the offspring of humans and orcs. They have bonuses to Strength and Constitution and penalties to Charisma, and they have the infravision ability.

## Racial Characteristics

Each race has its own unique characteristics, which can include:

- **Ability Score Adjustments**: Most races have adjustments to certain ability scores, reflecting their natural aptitudes and limitations.
- **Special Abilities**: Many races have special abilities, such as infravision, resistance to certain types of magic, or the ability to detect certain features.
- **Class Restrictions**: Most races have restrictions on the classes they can choose and the levels they can reach in those classes.
- **Alignment Tendencies**: Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, though individual characters can deviate from these tendencies.
- **Language Abilities**: Each race has its own language and may have the ability to learn additional languages.
- **Physical Characteristics**: Each race has its own typical physical characteristics, including height, weight, appearance, and lifespan.

## Racial Relations

The relations between different races can be an important aspect of the campaign setting. The DM should consider the following factors when determining racial relations:

- **Historical Relations**: The history of interactions between different races can influence their current relations. Past conflicts, alliances, or other significant events can shape how members of different races view each other.
- **Cultural Differences**: Different races may have different cultural values, practices, and beliefs, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts.
- **Geographical Proximity**: Races that live in close proximity to each other may have more complex and nuanced relations than races that rarely interact.
- **Individual Variation**: While there may be general patterns in how members of different races interact, individual characters can deviate from these patterns based on their personal experiences and beliefs.

## Racial Tendencies

Each race has tendencies toward certain behaviors, attitudes, and alignments. These tendencies are not absolute, and individual characters can deviate from them, but they provide a general framework for understanding the race. The DM should consider these tendencies when creating NPCs and when guiding players in the creation and role-playing of their characters.

## Conclusion

Character races add diversity and depth to the AD&D game, providing players with a range of options for creating their characters and providing the DM with a rich tapestry of cultures and societies for the campaign setting. The DM should use the racial characteristics, relations, and tendencies as guidelines, adapting them as necessary to suit the specific needs and preferences of the campaign.
