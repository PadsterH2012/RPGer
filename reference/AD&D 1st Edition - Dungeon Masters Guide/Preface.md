# Preface

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS is first and foremost a game for the fun and enjoyment of those who seek to use imagination and creativity. This Advanced Dungeons & Dragons system has been designed, revised, and updated from previous editions of the game to make it easier and more fun to play.

The AD&D system is, as the name implies, advanced. While it has been made easier to learn and more fun to play, it is a complex game system, and although this volume has been written as clearly and concisely as possible, there are many areas of the game which are open to interpretation by the Dungeon Master. This is as it should be, for the final authority in any RPG situation is the DM.

The material herein is directed to DMs, and it includes information necessary to all phases of play. The players of the game need know only that material which pertains to their game personas, information about equipment, spells, and so forth. The DM is the game moderator and is responsible for the entire campaign and its milieu. The players must rely upon the DM, and the DM must provide an environment which transcends the mundane and allows for the extraordinary. Each DM must develop a milieu of his or her own, or, using the work of another as a base, create such a milieu.

The keynote here is that the milieu must be one which allows participants to imagine and develop their personae. It must be a place where adventure and excitement are possible, where cleverness and bravery are rewarded, and where the impossible can become possible through the exercise of imagination, teamwork, and a bit of luck. The AD&D game system is designed to allow such a milieu to be created and to flourish.

The AD&D system is more than a framework around which individual DMs construct their respective milieux. It is a colorful world of fantasy adventure, a basis for the development of new and different kinds of games, and a system which allows individualization and personalization while remaining a whole and playable game system. It is not a rehash of the old, but it is the original game system reorganized, expanded, and improved.

The game is complex, and it is open-ended. It is a game system which allows for hundreds of thousands of possible characters, each different from all others. It likewise allows for the creation of countless monsters and other beings, the development of endless adventure scenarios, and the possibility of great enjoyment from a game which can be as simple or as complex as the DM and players wish.

The AD&D system is a game which is fun to play and fun to DM. It is, as are most role-playing games, fun because it allows for creativity on the part of players and DMs alike. It is an imaginative game, and it has no real boundaries.
