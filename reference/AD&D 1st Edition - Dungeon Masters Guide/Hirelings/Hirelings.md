# Hirelings

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, hirelings are non-player characters (NPCs) who are employed by player characters to perform specific services for payment. Unlike henchmen, who are loyal followers who share in adventures and risks, hirelings are employees who perform specific tasks for wages. This section provides an overview of hirelings and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in the campaign.

## Types of Hirelings

There are two main categories of hirelings in the AD&D game:

- **Standard Hirelings**: These are common laborers, servants, and other unskilled or semi-skilled workers who perform routine tasks. Examples include porters, cooks, grooms, and guards.
- **Expert Hirelings**: These are skilled professionals who provide specialized services. Examples include armorers, blacksmiths, engineers, sages, and ship captains.

## Hiring Process

The process of hiring NPCs typically involves the following steps:

- **Finding Potential Hirelings**: Characters must find potential hirelings, either by visiting appropriate locations (such as taverns, marketplaces, or guild halls) or by posting notices or spreading word of their needs.
- **Negotiating Terms**: Characters must negotiate the terms of employment, including wages, duties, duration, and any special conditions.
- **Checking References**: Characters may wish to check the references or reputation of potential hirelings, particularly for important or sensitive positions.
- **Finalizing the Agreement**: Once terms are agreed upon, the employment agreement is finalized, typically with a handshake or a written contract.

## Wages and Conditions

The wages and conditions of employment for hirelings vary depending on their skills, the tasks they are hired to perform, and the prevailing economic conditions:

- **Standard Hirelings**: Standard hirelings typically earn 1-3 silver pieces per day, plus room and board. Hazardous duties or unpleasant conditions may require higher wages.
- **Expert Hirelings**: Expert hirelings typically earn 3-30 gold pieces per day, depending on their skills and the rarity of their expertise. They may also require specific working conditions, materials, or assistants.
- **Payment Schedule**: Hirelings are typically paid daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the nature of their employment and local customs.
- **Room and Board**: In addition to wages, hirelings typically expect to be provided with room and board, or to receive additional payment to cover these expenses.
- **Equipment**: Hirelings may provide their own tools and equipment, or they may expect the employer to provide these items.

## Loyalty and Morale

The loyalty and morale of hirelings affect their performance and reliability:

- **Loyalty Base**: Each hireling has a loyalty base determined by the employer's Charisma and other factors. This loyalty can be increased by good treatment and decreased by poor treatment.
- **Morale Checks**: Hirelings may be required to make morale checks in dangerous or stressful situations. The result of these checks determines whether they continue to perform their duties, flee, or take other actions.
- **Treatment**: The treatment of hirelings by their employers significantly affects their loyalty and morale. Fair wages, good working conditions, respect, and occasional bonuses or rewards can improve loyalty and morale, while poor wages, harsh conditions, disrespect, or mistreatment can decrease them.

## Managing Hirelings

The DM should consider the following factors when managing hirelings in the campaign:

- **Personality**: Each hireling should have a distinct personality, with their own goals, fears, and quirks. This adds depth to the game and provides role-playing opportunities.
- **Skills and Abilities**: Each hireling should have specific skills and abilities that define what they can and cannot do. These should be consistent with their background and experience.
- **Availability**: The availability of hirelings should be influenced by the campaign setting. In a large city, a wide variety of hirelings might be available, while in a small village, options might be limited.
- **Reliability**: Not all hirelings are equally reliable. Some may be lazy, dishonest, or incompetent, while others may be hardworking, honest, and skilled. The DM should determine the reliability of each hireling based on their personality and background.
- **Advancement**: Long-term hirelings may improve their skills over time, potentially becoming more valuable to their employers. The DM should consider allowing for such advancement, particularly for hirelings who are treated well and given opportunities to learn and grow.

## Hirelings in Adventures

While hirelings are primarily employed for specific tasks rather than for adventuring, they may sometimes accompany characters on adventures:

- **Limited Role**: Hirelings who accompany characters on adventures typically have a limited role, such as carrying equipment, setting up camp, or providing specific services (like cooking or animal care).
- **Danger Pay**: Hirelings who are asked to accompany characters into dangerous situations typically demand higher wages, often referred to as "danger pay."
- **Combat Participation**: Most hirelings are not combatants and will avoid combat if possible. Those who are hired specifically as guards or for other combat roles may participate in combat, but they typically expect appropriate compensation for the risks involved.
- **Casualties**: If a hireling is injured or killed while in a character's employ, there may be legal, financial, or social consequences. The character may be required to pay compensation to the hireling or their family, and their reputation may suffer.

## Conclusion

Hirelings add depth and realism to the AD&D game, providing characters with access to services and skills they may lack and creating opportunities for role-playing and campaign development. The DM should use hirelings as a tool to enhance the game experience, creating interesting NPCs with distinct personalities and abilities who can contribute to the campaign in meaningful ways.
