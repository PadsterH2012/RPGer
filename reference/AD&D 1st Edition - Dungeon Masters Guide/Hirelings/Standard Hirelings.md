# Standard Hirelings

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Standard hirelings in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are common laborers, servants, and other unskilled or semi-skilled workers who perform routine tasks for payment. This section provides detailed information on standard hirelings and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in the campaign.

## Types of Standard Hirelings

There are many types of standard hirelings that characters might employ:

- **Bearers/Porters**: Individuals hired to carry equipment, supplies, or treasure. They typically have no combat skills and will flee if danger threatens.
- **Cooks**: Individuals hired to prepare meals for the party or for a household. A good cook can improve morale and may have knowledge of local herbs and ingredients.
- **Grooms**: Individuals hired to care for horses and other mounts. They are skilled in feeding, grooming, and basic veterinary care for animals.
- **Guards**: Individuals hired to protect persons, places, or things. They typically have basic combat skills and may be armed with spears, swords, or other weapons.
- **Laborers**: Individuals hired for general physical work, such as digging, carrying, or construction. They have no specialized skills but are capable of sustained physical effort.
- **Linkboys/Torchbearers**: Individuals hired to carry torches or lanterns to provide light. They are particularly useful in dungeons or other dark places.
- **Messengers**: Individuals hired to deliver messages or small packages. They are typically fast runners or riders and may know shortcuts or safe routes.
- **Servants**: Individuals hired for general household duties, such as cleaning, serving food, or running errands.
- **Stablehands**: Individuals hired to work in stables, caring for horses and other animals. They are similar to grooms but typically work in a fixed location rather than traveling with the party.

## Hiring Standard Hirelings

The process of hiring standard hirelings typically involves the following steps:

- **Finding Potential Hirelings**: Standard hirelings can typically be found in taverns, marketplaces, or other public places. In larger settlements, there may be hiring halls or other locations specifically for finding employment.
- **Negotiating Terms**: The terms of employment, including wages, duties, and duration, must be negotiated. Standard hirelings typically have standard rates, but these can be influenced by supply and demand, the character's Charisma, and other factors.
- **Finalizing the Agreement**: Once terms are agreed upon, the employment agreement is finalized, typically with a handshake. Written contracts are rare for standard hirelings, except for long-term employment or special circumstances.

## Wages and Conditions

The wages and conditions for standard hirelings vary depending on their specific role, the local economy, and other factors:

- **Base Wages**: Standard hirelings typically earn 1-3 silver pieces per day, plus room and board. The specific amount depends on the hireling's role, with more demanding or skilled roles commanding higher wages.
- **Hazard Pay**: Hirelings who are asked to enter dangerous areas or perform hazardous duties typically demand additional payment, often referred to as "hazard pay." This might be 2-3 times their normal wage.
- **Room and Board**: In addition to wages, standard hirelings typically expect to be provided with room and board, or to receive additional payment to cover these expenses.
- **Equipment**: Standard hirelings typically provide their own clothing and personal items, but they expect the employer to provide any specialized equipment needed for their duties.
- **Working Conditions**: Standard hirelings expect reasonable working conditions, including adequate rest periods, shelter from the elements, and protection from unnecessary dangers.

## Typical Wages for Standard Hirelings

The following are typical daily wages for various types of standard hirelings:

- **Bearer/Porter**: 1 silver piece per day, plus 1 additional silver piece per 100 coins of weight carried.
- **Cook**: 2 silver pieces per day.
- **Groom**: 1 silver piece per day.
- **Guard**: 2 silver pieces per day for an untrained guard, 5 silver pieces per day for a trained guard.
- **Laborer**: 1 silver piece per day.
- **Linkboy/Torchbearer**: 1 silver piece per day, plus 1 additional silver piece for entering dangerous areas.
- **Messenger**: 1 silver piece per message within a settlement, 1 silver piece per mile for longer distances.
- **Servant**: 5 copper pieces per day.
- **Stablehand**: 5 copper pieces per day.

These wages are guidelines and may vary based on local economic conditions, the character's Charisma, and other factors.

## Loyalty and Morale

The loyalty and morale of standard hirelings affect their performance and reliability:

- **Loyalty Base**: Each hireling has a loyalty base determined by the employer's Charisma and other factors. For standard hirelings, this is typically 50% plus or minus the employer's Charisma adjustment percentage.
- **Morale Checks**: Standard hirelings may be required to make morale checks in dangerous or stressful situations. The result of these checks determines whether they continue to perform their duties, flee, or take other actions.
- **Treatment**: The treatment of hirelings by their employers significantly affects their loyalty and morale. Fair wages, good working conditions, respect, and occasional bonuses or rewards can improve loyalty and morale, while poor wages, harsh conditions, disrespect, or mistreatment can decrease them.

## Managing Standard Hirelings

The DM should consider the following factors when managing standard hirelings in the campaign:

- **Personality**: Each hireling should have a distinct personality, with their own goals, fears, and quirks. This adds depth to the game and provides role-playing opportunities.
- **Skills and Abilities**: Each hireling should have specific skills and abilities that define what they can and cannot do. These should be consistent with their background and experience.
- **Reliability**: Not all hirelings are equally reliable. Some may be lazy, dishonest, or incompetent, while others may be hardworking, honest, and skilled. The DM should determine the reliability of each hireling based on their personality and background.
- **Advancement**: Long-term hirelings may improve their skills over time, potentially becoming more valuable to their employers. The DM should consider allowing for such advancement, particularly for hirelings who are treated well and given opportunities to learn and grow.

## Standard Hirelings in Adventures

While standard hirelings are primarily employed for specific tasks rather than for adventuring, they may sometimes accompany characters on adventures:

- **Limited Role**: Standard hirelings who accompany characters on adventures typically have a limited role, such as carrying equipment, setting up camp, or providing specific services (like cooking or animal care).
- **Danger Pay**: Standard hirelings who are asked to accompany characters into dangerous situations typically demand higher wages, often referred to as "danger pay."
- **Combat Avoidance**: Most standard hirelings are not combatants and will avoid combat if possible. They typically have 0-level statistics, with 1-6 hit points and no special abilities.
- **Casualties**: If a standard hireling is injured or killed while in a character's employ, there may be legal, financial, or social consequences. The character may be required to pay compensation to the hireling or their family, and their reputation may suffer.

## Conclusion

Standard hirelings add depth and realism to the AD&D game, providing characters with access to common services and creating opportunities for role-playing and campaign development. The DM should use standard hirelings as a tool to enhance the game experience, creating interesting NPCs with distinct personalities who can contribute to the campaign in meaningful ways.
