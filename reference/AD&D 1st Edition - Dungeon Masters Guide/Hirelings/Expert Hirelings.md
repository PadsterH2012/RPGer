*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

## Hiring Expert Hirelings

The process of hiring expert hirelings typically involves the following steps:

- **Finding Potential Hirelings**: Expert hirelings can typically be found through guilds, professional associations, or recommendations from other professionals. In larger settlements, there may be specific districts or establishments where experts of various types can be found.
- **Negotiating Terms**: The terms of employment, including wages, duties, duration, and any special conditions, must be negotiated. Expert hirelings typically have standard rates for their services, but these can be influenced by the character's Charisma, the complexity of the task, and other factors.
- **Checking References**: Characters may wish to check the references or reputation of potential expert hirelings, particularly for important or sensitive tasks.
- **Finalizing the Agreement**: Once terms are agreed upon, the employment agreement is finalized, often with a written contract, particularly for complex or long-term arrangements.

## Wages and Conditions

The wages and conditions for expert hirelings vary depending on their specific expertise, the complexity of the task, and other factors:

- **Base Wages**: Expert hirelings typically earn 3-30 gold pieces per day, depending on their skills and the rarity of their expertise. The specific amount depends on the hireling's role, with more specialized or rare skills commanding higher wages.
- **Project-Based Payment**: Some expert hirelings may prefer to be paid per project rather than per day, particularly for tasks with a clear deliverable, such as creating a piece of armor or translating a text.
- **Materials and Equipment**: Expert hirelings typically expect the employer to provide or pay for any materials or specialized equipment needed for their work.
- **Working Conditions**: Expert hirelings expect appropriate working conditions for their craft or profession, which may include a workshop, laboratory, quiet study, or other specific environment.
- **Assistants**: Some expert hirelings may require or request assistants to help with their work, particularly for complex or large-scale projects.

The following are typical daily wages for various types of expert hirelings:

## Loyalty and Morale

The loyalty and morale of expert hirelings affect their performance and reliability:

- **Professional Pride**: Expert hirelings typically take pride in their work and will strive to maintain their professional reputation. This can be a stronger motivator than loyalty to an employer.
- **Loyalty Base**: Each hireling has a loyalty base determined by the employer's Charisma and other factors. For expert hirelings, this is typically 50% plus or minus the employer's Charisma adjustment percentage.
- **Treatment**: The treatment of expert hirelings by their employers significantly affects their loyalty and morale. Respect for their expertise, fair payment, appropriate working conditions, and recognition of their contributions can improve loyalty and morale, while disrespect, poor payment, inadequate working conditions, or lack of recognition can decrease them.

## Managing Expert Hirelings

The DM should consider the following factors when managing expert hirelings in the campaign:

- **Expertise Level**: Each expert hireling should have a specific level of expertise in their field, which determines the quality and complexity of work they can perform. This can be represented by a percentage chance of success for complex tasks, with more skilled experts having higher percentages.
- **Personality**: Each hireling should have a distinct personality, with their own goals, fears, and quirks. This adds depth to the game and provides role-playing opportunities.
- **Professional Network**: Expert hirelings typically have connections with other professionals in their field and related fields. These connections can be a valuable resource for characters who treat the hireling well.
- **Time Requirements**: Complex tasks performed by expert hirelings typically require significant time to complete. The DM should determine realistic timeframes for various tasks, considering the complexity of the task and the skill of the hireling.

## Expert Hirelings in Adventures

While expert hirelings are primarily employed for their specialized skills rather than for adventuring, they may sometimes accompany characters on adventures:

- **Specific Purpose**: Expert hirelings who accompany characters on adventures typically do so for a specific purpose related to their expertise, such as an engineer assessing a ruined structure or a sage translating ancient inscriptions.
- **Danger Pay**: Expert hirelings who are asked to accompany characters into dangerous situations typically demand higher wages, often referred to as "danger pay."
- **Protection**: Expert hirelings typically expect to be protected by the characters who hired them, as they are not combatants and are valuable for their expertise rather than their fighting ability.
- **Limited Duration**: Expert hirelings typically accompany characters on adventures for limited durations, returning to their normal work once their specific task is completed.

## Conclusion

Expert hirelings add depth and realism to the AD&D game, providing characters with access to specialized skills and knowledge and creating opportunities for role-playing and campaign development. The DM should use expert hirelings as a tool to enhance the game experience, creating interesting NPCs with distinct personalities and abilities who can contribute to the campaign in meaningful ways.
