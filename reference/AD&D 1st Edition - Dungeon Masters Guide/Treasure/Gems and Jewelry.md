- **Weight**: Gems are typically measured in carats, with one carat equal to 1/5 of a gram. A typical gem weighs 1-10 carats, with more valuable gems often being lighter than less valuable ones of the same size.
- **Encumbrance**: For game purposes, gems are generally considered to have negligible weight for encumbrance calculations, with 100 gems weighing approximately 1 pound.

## Jewelry

Jewelry consists of ornamental items made from precious metals and often incorporating gems:

### Types of Jewelry

Jewelry comes in various forms:

- **Rings**: Circular bands worn on fingers, ranging from simple metal bands to elaborate designs with multiple gems.
- **Necklaces**: Chains or strings of metal, gems, or other materials worn around the neck, including pendants (single ornaments suspended from chains).
- **Bracelets**: Circular bands worn on wrists or ankles, similar to rings but larger.
- **Earrings**: Ornaments worn on or through the ears, either as simple studs or more elaborate dangling designs.
- **Crowns and Tiaras**: Ornamental headwear, often signifying royalty or high status.
- **Brooches and Pins**: Ornaments fastened to clothing with pins or clasps.
- **Amulets and Talismans**: Ornaments worn for supposed magical or protective properties.
- **Belt Buckles**: Decorative fasteners for belts, sometimes quite elaborate and valuable.
- **Hair Ornaments**: Combs, clips, and other items worn in the hair.
- **Armlets**: Bands worn on the upper arm, similar to bracelets but larger.

### Jewelry Materials

Jewelry is made from various materials:

- **Precious Metals**: Gold, silver, platinum, and electrum are the most common metals used in valuable jewelry.
- **Gems**: Jewelry often incorporates gems of various types and values, as described in the gems section.
- **Other Materials**: Some jewelry may incorporate other materials such as coral, amber, ivory, exotic woods, or even more unusual substances like dragon scales or monster teeth.

### Jewelry Value

The value of jewelry depends on several factors:

- **Base Value**: Jewelry typically has a base value of 3d6 × 10 gp (30-180 gp), 3d6 × 100 gp (300-1,800 gp), 3d6 × 500 gp (1,500-9,000 gp), 3d6 × 1,000 gp (3,000-18,000 gp), 3d6 × 5,000 gp (15,000-90,000 gp), or 3d6 × 10,000 gp (30,000-180,000 gp), depending on its materials, craftsmanship, and incorporated gems.
- **Material Value**: The value of the precious metals and gems used in the jewelry contributes significantly to its overall value.
- **Craftsmanship**: The quality of the craftsmanship affects the jewelry's value, with exceptionally well-crafted pieces being worth more than poorly crafted ones using the same materials.
- **Artistic Merit**: Jewelry with high artistic merit, such as pieces created by renowned artisans or with particularly beautiful or innovative designs, may be worth more than their material value would suggest.
- **Cultural or Historical Significance**: Jewelry with cultural or historical significance, such as royal regalia or religious artifacts, may be worth far more than its material value to the right buyer.

### Jewelry Size and Weight

Jewelry varies in size and weight:

- **Size**: Jewelry ranges from small rings and earrings to large crowns and elaborate necklaces.
- **Weight**: The weight of jewelry depends on its size, materials, and design, with items made primarily of precious metals being heavier than those that incorporate more gems.
- **Encumbrance**: For game purposes, jewelry is generally considered to have minimal weight for encumbrance calculations, with 10-20 pieces of average jewelry weighing approximately 1 pound.

## Valuation and Appraisal

Determining the exact value of gems and jewelry requires appraisal:

- **Identification**: Characters with appropriate skills or backgrounds may be able to identify the general type and approximate value of gems and jewelry.
- **Appraisal**: Accurate appraisal typically requires the services of a professional appraiser, such as a jeweler, gemcutter, or other expert.
- **Appraisal Cost**: Professional appraisal typically costs a percentage of the item's value, often 1-5%, with a minimum fee for less valuable items.
- **Appraisal Accuracy**: The accuracy of an appraisal depends on the skill of the appraiser and the time and tools available for the appraisal.
- **Self-Appraisal**: Characters may attempt to appraise gems and jewelry themselves, but without appropriate skills and tools, their estimates may be significantly off.

## Market Considerations

The market for gems and jewelry affects their practical value:

- **Liquidity**: Gems and jewelry are generally more liquid than other forms of wealth, such as art objects or land, but less liquid than coins.
- **Sale Value**: Characters typically receive only 50-80% of the full value when selling gems and jewelry, depending on market conditions, their negotiation skills, and the specific items.
- **Purchase Value**: Conversely, characters typically pay 100-150% of the full value when purchasing gems and jewelry.
- **Market Limitations**: Small communities may not have the resources to purchase very valuable gems or jewelry, requiring characters to seek larger settlements or specific buyers for high-value items.
- **Special Buyers**: Certain gems or jewelry pieces may be of particular interest to specific buyers, such as collectors, scholars, or individuals with cultural or personal connections to the items, potentially resulting in higher sale values.

## Gems and Jewelry in the Campaign

Gems and jewelry can serve various roles in the campaign:

- **Treasure**: As valuable, portable wealth, gems and jewelry are common components of treasure hoards.
- **Currency**: In some situations, gems and jewelry may serve as currency, particularly for large transactions or in areas where coins are impractical or mistrusted.
- **Status Symbols**: Characters may wear or display valuable gems and jewelry as symbols of their wealth and status.
- **Plot Devices**: Specific gems or jewelry pieces may serve as plot devices, such as royal regalia that legitimizes a claim to the throne, a family heirloom with sentimental value, or a gem with unique magical properties.
- **Magical Components**: Gems and jewelry may serve as components for spells or the creation of magical items.
- **Cultural Elements**: Different cultures in the campaign world may have different traditions and preferences regarding gems and jewelry, adding depth and flavor to the setting.

## Conclusion

Gems and jewelry are important elements of treasure in the AD&D game, providing valuable, portable wealth that contributes to character advancement through experience points while also offering opportunities for role-playing, world-building, and storytelling. The DM should use gems and jewelry thoughtfully to enhance the campaign, considering their value, appearance, and potential significance beyond their monetary worth. By understanding the different types and qualities of gems and jewelry, the DM can create more varied and interesting treasures that contribute to the richness and detail of the campaign world.
