# Dividing Treasure

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Dividing treasure in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is the process by which player characters allocate the wealth and items they acquire during their adventures. This section provides guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling treasure division and resolving potential conflicts that may arise.

## Principles of Treasure Division

Several principles typically guide the division of treasure:

- **Fairness**: Treasure division should generally be fair, with each character receiving a reasonable share based on their contribution and needs.
- **Practicality**: Treasure division should be practical, considering the nature of the items, the abilities and restrictions of the characters, and the overall benefit to the party.
- **Efficiency**: Treasure division should be efficient, maximizing the overall benefit to the party rather than strictly adhering to equal numerical shares.
- **Harmony**: Treasure division should promote harmony within the party, avoiding conflicts that could disrupt the game or damage player relationships.
- **Character Development**: Treasure division should support character development, with items going to characters who can use them effectively and in ways that enhance their concept and role.

## Methods of Treasure Division

Various methods can be used to divide treasure:

- **Equal Shares**: The total value of the treasure is divided equally among all characters, with items being assigned values and characters taking items up to their share value or receiving coins to make up any difference.
- **Need-Based Division**: Items are assigned to characters who can use them most effectively, with remaining treasure divided to balance the overall value received by each character.
- **Class-Based Division**: Certain types of items are automatically assigned to specific classes (such as magic weapons to fighters or spell scrolls to magic-users), with remaining treasure divided among all characters.
- **Contribution-Based Division**: Characters receive shares based on their contribution to acquiring the treasure, with those who took greater risks or played more crucial roles receiving larger shares.
- **Bidding Systems**: Characters bid on desired items using their share of the treasure, with the highest bidder receiving the item and the bid amount being redistributed among the other characters.
- **Random Assignment**: Items are assigned randomly, such as by rolling dice, drawing lots, or using other chance-based methods.

## Dividing Different Types of Treasure

Different types of treasure may be divided in different ways:

- **Coins**: Coins are the easiest treasure to divide, as they can be counted and split precisely. Characters typically receive equal shares of coins, possibly adjusted for other items received.
- **Gems and Jewelry**: Gems and jewelry can be divided based on their appraised value, either by assigning specific pieces to characters or by selling them and dividing the proceeds.
- **Magic Items**: Magic items are often the most challenging to divide fairly, as their utility varies by character class and their value is difficult to quantify precisely. They are typically assigned based on need, class suitability, or other agreed-upon methods.
- **Art Objects and Other Valuables**: Art objects and other valuable items can be divided similarly to gems and jewelry, based on their appraised value.
- **Consumable Items**: Consumable items such as potions and scrolls may be divided based on immediate need or held in a common pool for use as needed during adventures.

## Role of the Dungeon Master

The DM plays several roles in treasure division:

- **Facilitator**: The DM facilitates the treasure division process, providing information about items, suggesting methods, and helping to resolve disagreements.
- **Information Provider**: The DM provides information about the items found, including their nature, properties, and approximate value, though some information may be withheld until items are properly identified.
- **Arbiter**: When disagreements arise, the DM may serve as an arbiter, helping to find fair solutions that maintain game balance and party harmony.
- **NPC Representative**: The DM represents the interests of any NPCs who are entitled to a share of the treasure, such as henchmen, hirelings, or allied characters.
- **World Responder**: The DM determines how the world responds to the characters' acquisition and use of treasure, including the reactions of merchants, authorities, thieves, and others who might take an interest in their newfound wealth.

## Henchmen and Hirelings

Henchmen and hirelings may be entitled to shares of treasure:

- **Henchmen**: Henchmen typically receive a half share or quarter share of treasure, depending on their level, contribution, and relationship with their employer.
- **Hirelings**: Hirelings typically receive their agreed-upon wages rather than a share of treasure, though they may receive bonuses for exceptional service or particularly successful adventures.
- **Specialists**: Specialists such as sages, alchemists, or engineers who provide specific services may receive payment for those services rather than a general share of treasure.
- **Mercenaries**: Mercenaries typically receive their agreed-upon wages plus any bonuses specified in their contract, which may include a small percentage of treasure found.
- **Share Determination**: The specific share for each NPC should be determined in advance, either through negotiation when they are hired or based on standard practices in the campaign world.

## Handling Disputes

Disputes over treasure division can arise and should be handled carefully:

- **Preventive Measures**: Many disputes can be prevented by establishing clear methods for treasure division in advance, either at the beginning of the campaign or before specific adventures.
- **Character-Level Resolution**: When disputes arise, they should first be addressed at the character level, with the characters discussing and negotiating a resolution within the context of the game world.
- **Player-Level Discussion**: If character-level resolution is unsuccessful, the players may need to discuss the issue out of character, focusing on fairness, practicality, and the overall enjoyment of the game.
- **DM Intervention**: If player-level discussion is unsuccessful, the DM may need to intervene, suggesting compromises, making rulings, or even imposing solutions to prevent the dispute from disrupting the game.
- **Consequences**: In some cases, disputes over treasure may have in-game consequences, such as damage to character relationships, loss of reputation, or even the dissolution of the party, which can be incorporated into the campaign narrative.

## Special Considerations

Various special considerations may affect treasure division:

- **Character Death**: When a character dies, their possessions typically become available to the party. The disposition of these items should be handled sensitively, considering factors such as the possibility of resurrection, the character's wishes, and any heirs or beneficiaries.
- **Character Departure**: When a character leaves the party (due to player departure, character retirement, or other reasons), their share of party resources and any items specifically assigned to them typically go with them, though some items may be returned to the party if appropriate.
- **New Characters**: New characters joining the party may not immediately receive a full share of accumulated treasure, particularly magic items, until they have proven themselves or contributed to new acquisitions.
- **Party Funds**: Some parties maintain a common fund for shared expenses such as healing, information, or equipment that benefits the entire group. Contributions to and disbursements from this fund should be tracked and managed fairly.
- **Unique or Significant Items**: Items of unique significance, such as quest objects, plot-relevant artifacts, or items with strong ties to specific characters, may require special handling beyond normal treasure division methods.

## Record Keeping

Accurate record keeping is important for treasure division:

- **Treasure Log**: Maintaining a log of treasure found, including the nature, value, and disposition of each item, helps prevent confusion and disputes.
- **Character Inventories**: Each character should maintain an accurate inventory of their possessions, including items received through treasure division.
- **Party Assets**: A record of party assets, including any items held in common or funds in a party treasury, should be maintained and updated regularly.
- **Debts and Credits**: Any debts or credits between characters, such as loans or payments for services, should be recorded and tracked.
- **Responsibility**: The responsibility for record keeping may be assigned to a specific player, shared among all players, or managed by the DM, depending on the preferences of the group.

## Conclusion

Dividing treasure is an important aspect of the AD&D game, providing characters with the resources they need to advance and succeed while also potentially creating interesting role-playing opportunities and challenges. The DM should facilitate a fair and efficient treasure division process that enhances the game experience for all players, considering the principles, methods, and special considerations outlined in this section. By establishing clear procedures and addressing disputes constructively, the DM can ensure that treasure division contributes positively to the campaign rather than becoming a source of conflict or disruption.
