# Treasure

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Treasure in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game represents the material rewards that characters can obtain through their adventures. This section provides an overview of treasure and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on creating, placing, and managing treasure in the campaign.

## Nature of Treasure

Treasure in the AD&D game has the following characteristics:

- **Reward System**: Treasure serves as a tangible reward for successful adventures, providing both immediate gratification and long-term benefits.
- **Experience Source**: Non-magical treasure provides experience points, typically at a rate of 1 XP per 1 gold piece value, making it a significant source of character advancement.
- **Resource Acquisition**: Treasure provides resources that characters can use to purchase equipment, services, training, and other necessities or luxuries.
- **Character Enhancement**: Magical treasure, particularly magic items, enhances characters' abilities and provides new options for overcoming challenges.
- **Story Element**: Treasure can serve as a story element, with specific items driving plots, creating conflicts, or revealing aspects of the campaign world's history or culture.

## Types of Treasure

There are several types of treasure in the AD&D game:

- **Coins**: The most basic form of treasure, including copper pieces (cp), silver pieces (sp), electrum pieces (ep), gold pieces (gp), and platinum pieces (pp), with varying values and weights.
- **Gems**: Precious and semi-precious stones of various types and values, from relatively common quartz or amber to rare diamonds or rubies.
- **Jewelry**: Ornamental items made from precious metals and often incorporating gems, including rings, necklaces, bracelets, crowns, and other decorative pieces.
- **Art Objects**: Valuable items created for aesthetic purposes, such as paintings, sculptures, tapestries, or ornate furniture, which may have cultural or historical significance.
- **Trade Goods**: Valuable commodities such as spices, silks, furs, or rare woods, which may be more common in merchant-focused campaigns or as rewards from commercial ventures.
- **Magic Items**: Items imbued with magical properties, including weapons, armor, potions, scrolls, wands, rings, and various miscellaneous items, which provide special abilities or effects.

## Treasure Placement

The DM should consider the following factors when placing treasure:

- **Monster Type**: Different types of monsters are associated with different types and amounts of treasure, as indicated by their treasure type in the Monster Manual. Intelligent creatures typically have more organized and valuable treasure than unintelligent ones.
- **Location Appropriateness**: Treasure should be appropriate to its location, with more valuable treasure typically found in more dangerous or remote areas.
- **Protection Level**: More valuable treasure should typically have greater protection, such as stronger monsters, more complex traps, or better hiding places.
- **Campaign Balance**: The overall amount of treasure should be balanced to support the desired pace of character advancement and the economy of the campaign world.
- **Logical Placement**: Treasure should be placed in locations that make logical sense, such as in a dragon's hoard, a bandit leader's chest, or a forgotten tomb, rather than randomly distributed without context.

## Treasure Tables

The AD&D game provides various tables for generating treasure:

- **Treasure Type Tables**: These tables, labeled A through Z, indicate the types and amounts of treasure typically associated with different monsters. Each treasure type specifies the probability and amount of coins, gems, jewelry, and magic items.
- **Individual Treasure Tables**: These tables indicate the treasure typically carried by individual monsters, as opposed to the larger hoards associated with lairs or groups.
- **Gem Tables**: These tables determine the type, quality, and value of gems found as treasure, with values typically ranging from 10 gp to 5,000 gp or more.
- **Jewelry Tables**: These tables determine the type, materials, and value of jewelry found as treasure, with values typically ranging from 50 gp to 10,000 gp or more.
- **Magic Item Tables**: These tables determine the specific magic items found as treasure, organized by category (potions, scrolls, rings, etc.) and with varying rarities and powers.

## Treasure Value

The value of treasure is an important consideration:

- **Standard Values**: Coins have standard values: copper pieces are worth 1/100 gp, silver pieces are worth 1/10 gp, electrum pieces are worth 1/2 gp, gold pieces are worth 1 gp, and platinum pieces are worth 5 gp.
- **Gem and Jewelry Valuation**: The value of gems and jewelry must be determined through appraisal, which may require the services of a skilled appraiser or appropriate spells. The actual value may differ from the base value due to quality, craftsmanship, or cultural factors.
- **Art Object Valuation**: Art objects are particularly subject to valuation variations, as their worth depends not only on materials and craftsmanship but also on cultural significance, artist reputation, and potential collector interest.
- **Magic Item Value**: Magic items typically do not have a standard gold piece value for experience purposes, as their value lies in their magical properties rather than their monetary worth. However, they may have a sale or purchase value in campaigns where such transactions are possible.
- **Market Factors**: The actual value that characters can realize from selling treasure may be less than its base value, typically 50-80% depending on market conditions, character negotiation skills, and the nature of the item.

## Managing Treasure

The DM should consider the following factors when managing treasure in the campaign:

- **Treasure Acquisition**: Characters must actually acquire treasure and bring it to a safe location to benefit from it, creating logistical challenges for bulky or heavy treasure.
- **Encumbrance**: Coins and other physical treasure have weight, with a standard coin weighing 1/10 pound. This creates encumbrance considerations for characters attempting to transport large amounts of treasure.
- **Storage and Protection**: Characters must find ways to store and protect their accumulated wealth, potentially leading to the establishment of strongholds, the use of banking services, or the creation of hidden caches.
- **Spending Opportunities**: The DM should provide appropriate opportunities for characters to spend their treasure, such as markets for equipment, services for training or research, or investments in property or businesses.
- **Treasure Recovery**: Not all treasure can be easily recovered, particularly in dangerous or remote locations. Characters may need to make multiple trips, hire porters, or use magical means to transport bulky or heavy treasure.

## Special Treasure Considerations

Various special considerations apply to treasure:

- **Cursed Items**: Some magical treasure may be cursed, providing penalties rather than benefits or having other negative effects. These items typically disguise their true nature until used, at which point they become difficult to discard.
- **Intelligent Items**: Some magic items, particularly weapons, may be intelligent, with their own personalities, alignments, and goals. These items can communicate with their wielders and may have specific requirements or restrictions.
- **Artifacts and Relics**: The most powerful magical treasures are artifacts and relics, unique items with multiple powers and potentially campaign-altering significance. These items typically have specific histories, purposes, and drawbacks.
- **Campaign-Specific Treasure**: The DM may create campaign-specific treasure that reflects the unique history, cultures, or magical systems of their campaign world, providing distinctive rewards that cannot be found in standard references.
- **Non-Material Treasure**: Not all treasure is material; characters may also receive intangible rewards such as titles, land grants, special privileges, or valuable information, which can be as valuable as physical treasure in the right circumstances.

## Conclusion

Treasure is a fundamental aspect of the AD&D game, providing rewards, resources, and enhancement opportunities for characters while also serving as a story element and experience source. The DM should use treasure thoughtfully to create a balanced and engaging campaign, considering factors such as placement, protection, valuation, and management. By understanding the different types of treasure and their roles in the game, the DM can create rewarding adventures that provide appropriate incentives for player engagement and character development.
