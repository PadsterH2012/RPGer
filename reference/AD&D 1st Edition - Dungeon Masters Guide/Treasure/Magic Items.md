# Magic Items

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Magic items in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are objects imbued with magical properties that provide special abilities or effects to their users. This section provides detailed information on magic items and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on creating, placing, and managing these powerful treasures in the campaign.

## Types of Magic Items

There are several categories of magic items in the AD&D game:

- **Potions**: Magical liquids that provide temporary effects when consumed, such as healing, invisibility, or flight.
- **Scrolls**: Magical writings that allow one-time casting of spells or provide other magical effects when read aloud.
- **Rings**: Magical jewelry worn on fingers that provide continuous effects while worn, such as protection, invisibility, or spell storing.
- **Rods, Staves, and Wands**: Magical implements that can cast spells or produce other effects, typically with a limited number of charges.
- **Weapons**: Magical armaments that provide bonuses to attack and damage rolls, and may have additional special properties.
- **Armor and Shields**: Magical protective gear that provides enhanced protection and may have additional special properties.
- **Miscellaneous Magic Items**: A diverse category including magical clothing, jewelry (other than rings), tools, and other objects with various effects.
- **Artifacts and Relics**: Unique, extremely powerful magic items with multiple abilities and significant roles in the campaign world.

## Magic Item Properties

Magic items have various properties that define their nature and use:

- **Bonuses**: Many magic items provide numerical bonuses to various aspects of the game, such as a sword +1 giving a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, or armor +2 improving Armor Class by 2 points beyond the armor's normal protection.
- **Special Abilities**: Many magic items have special abilities beyond simple bonuses, such as a sword that can detect secret doors, armor that provides resistance to certain types of damage, or a cloak that improves saving throws.
- **Charges**: Some magic items, particularly wands, staves, and certain miscellaneous items, have a limited number of charges that are expended when the item is used. Once all charges are used, the item becomes non-magical or, in some cases, can be recharged.
- **Command Words**: Many magic items require specific command words to activate their powers. These words must be discovered through research, identification spells, or experimentation.
- **Activation Methods**: Magic items may be activated by various methods, such as wearing or carrying them, speaking command words, performing specific actions, or expending charges.
- **Limitations**: Some magic items have limitations on their use, such as restrictions on who can use them (by class, alignment, or other factors), how often they can be used, or under what circumstances they function.

## Identifying Magic Items

Magic items must typically be identified to determine their properties:

- **Detection**: The detect magic spell can reveal that an item is magical but does not identify its specific properties.
- **Identification Spells**: The identify spell can reveal the properties of magic items, though it has limitations and costs in terms of material components and temporary Constitution loss.
- **Experimentation**: Characters can attempt to determine an item's properties through experimentation, though this can be risky with potentially harmful items.
- **Research**: Characters can research magic items in libraries or consult with sages or other knowledgeable individuals to learn about their properties.
- **Legend Lore**: The legend lore spell can provide information about particularly powerful or significant magic items.
- **Partial Identification**: Some properties of magic items may become apparent through use, while others remain hidden until properly identified.

## Creating Magic Items

The creation of magic items is a complex and resource-intensive process:

- **Creator Requirements**: Creating magic items typically requires a spellcaster of significant level (usually 9th level or higher) with access to specific spells related to the item's effects.
- **Time Investment**: Creating magic items requires substantial time, typically weeks or months depending on the power of the item.
- **Material Costs**: Creating magic items requires expensive materials, typically costing thousands or tens of thousands of gold pieces.
- **Energy Expenditure**: Creating magic items often requires the expenditure of personal energy, such as the permanent loss of Constitution points or the temporary inability to cast certain spells.
- **Research and Preparation**: Before creating a magic item, the creator must typically research the necessary processes and prepare special formulas, diagrams, or rituals.
- **Success Chance**: There is typically a chance of failure in creating magic items, with more powerful items having a higher chance of failure.

## Magic Item Placement

The DM should consider the following factors when placing magic items in the campaign:

- **Appropriateness**: Magic items should be appropriate to their location and the monsters or NPCs that possess them. A tribe of goblins might have a few minor magic items, while a dragon's hoard might contain several significant ones.
- **Balance**: The overall number and power of magic items should be balanced to maintain challenge and interest in the campaign. Too many powerful items can make challenges too easy, while too few can make certain obstacles nearly impossible.
- **Uniqueness**: Particularly powerful or significant magic items should be unique or rare, with histories, reputations, and perhaps even names that make them special within the campaign world.
- **Integration**: Magic items can be integrated into the campaign's stories and themes, serving as plot devices, quest objectives, or symbols of power and authority.
- **Logical Distribution**: Magic items should be distributed logically within the campaign world, with more powerful items in the possession of more powerful beings or in more dangerous and remote locations.

## Using Magic Items

The use of magic items involves several considerations:

- **Identification**: Characters must typically identify a magic item before they can use it effectively, though some items (such as potions) can be used experimentally.
- **Attunement**: Some magic items require a period of attunement or familiarization before their powers can be used, typically 1-8 hours of possession and concentration.
- **Activation**: Different magic items are activated in different ways, such as wearing them, speaking command words, performing specific actions, or expending charges.
- **Limitations**: Many magic items have limitations on their use, such as restrictions on who can use them, how often they can be used, or under what circumstances they function.
- **Combinations**: Some magic items may have enhanced or different effects when used in combination with other items or spells.
- **Side Effects**: Some magic items may have side effects or drawbacks, such as attracting certain monsters, causing personality changes, or creating dependency.

## Cursed Items

Some magic items are cursed, providing negative effects rather than benefits:

- **Disguise**: Cursed items typically appear to be beneficial items when detected or identified, with their true nature becoming apparent only after they are used or equipped.
- **Attachment**: Once a cursed item is used or equipped, it typically cannot be discarded without the use of specific spells such as remove curse.
- **Effects**: Cursed items can have various negative effects, such as penalties to abilities or saving throws, attraction of monsters, personality changes, or transformation of the user.
- **Removal**: Removing a cursed item typically requires a remove curse spell cast by a spellcaster of appropriate level, though some particularly powerful cursed items may require more complex solutions.
- **Dual Nature**: Some cursed items have both beneficial and harmful properties, creating interesting trade-offs for characters who use them.

## Intelligent Items

Some magic items, particularly weapons, may be intelligent:

- **Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma**: Intelligent items have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores that determine their mental capabilities and personality.
- **Communication**: Intelligent items can communicate with their users through various means, such as telepathy, speech, or empathic impressions.
- **Alignment**: Intelligent items have alignments that may conflict with those of their users, potentially leading to conflicts or even attempts by the item to control the user.
- **Powers**: Intelligent items typically have special powers beyond those of normal magic items, which they may use independently or grant to their users.
- **Ego**: Intelligent items have an Ego score that represents their force of personality. When an item's Ego exceeds the user's Wisdom or Charisma, the item may attempt to control the user or refuse to function.

## Artifacts and Relics

The most powerful magic items are artifacts and relics:

- **Unique Nature**: Artifacts and relics are unique items with specific histories, purposes, and roles in the campaign world.
- **Multiple Powers**: Artifacts and relics typically have multiple powers, often far beyond those of standard magic items.
- **Drawbacks**: Artifacts and relics typically have significant drawbacks or costs associated with their use, such as ability score penalties, attraction of powerful enemies, or corruption of the user.
- **Indestructibility**: Artifacts and relics are typically indestructible by normal means, requiring specific and often difficult methods to destroy.
- **Campaign Impact**: The presence of artifacts and relics can significantly impact a campaign, potentially becoming the focus of quests, conflicts, or major storylines.

## Conclusion

Magic items are a distinctive and exciting aspect of the AD&D game, providing characters with enhanced abilities and special powers while also serving as rewards, plot devices, and sources of wonder. The DM should use magic items thoughtfully to enhance the campaign, considering their placement, properties, and impact on game balance and storytelling. By understanding the different types of magic items and their roles in the game, the DM can create a magical environment that is both mechanically interesting and thematically rich.
