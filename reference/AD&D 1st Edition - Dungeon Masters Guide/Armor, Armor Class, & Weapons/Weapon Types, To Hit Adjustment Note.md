# Weapon Types, "To Hit" Adjustment Note

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, different types of weapons have varying effectiveness against different types of armor. This section provides detailed information on weapon types and their "to hit" adjustments against different armor classes.

## Weapon Types

Weapons in the AD&D game can be categorized into several types based on their design and method of use:

### Bludgeoning Weapons
- **Clubs**: Simple wooden weapons used for bludgeoning.
- **Maces**: Metal-headed weapons designed for crushing blows.
- **Hammers**: Similar to maces but with a hammer head instead of a flanged or spiked head.
- **Flails**: Weapons consisting of a handle connected by a chain or hinge to a striking head.
- **Staves**: Long wooden poles used for striking.

### Slashing Weapons
- **Swords**: Bladed weapons of various lengths and designs.
- **Axes**: Weapons with a metal blade attached to a handle.
- **Scimitars**: Curved swords designed for slashing.
- **Falchions**: Heavy, single-edged swords with a curved blade.

### Piercing Weapons
- **Daggers**: Short, pointed weapons designed for stabbing.
- **Spears**: Long shafted weapons with a pointed head.
- **Lances**: Long spears designed for use from horseback.
- **Arrows**: Projectiles shot from bows.
- **Bolts**: Projectiles shot from crossbows.

### Combination Weapons
- **Bastard Swords**: Swords that can be used for both slashing and piercing.
- **Long Swords**: Swords that can be used for both slashing and piercing.
- **Battle Axes**: Axes that can be used for both slashing and crushing.
- **Halberds**: Polearms that combine an axe blade, a spike, and a hook.

## Weapon vs. Armor Type Adjustments

The effectiveness of different types of weapons varies depending on the type of armor the target is wearing. This is represented by adjustments to the attack roll based on the combination of weapon and armor.

### Bludgeoning Weapons vs. Armor

Bludgeoning weapons are generally more effective against rigid armors like plate mail, as they can transmit force through the armor to cause injury. They are less effective against flexible armors like leather or chain mail, which can absorb and distribute the force of the blow.

- **vs. Padded, Leather, Studded Leather**: -1 to hit
- **vs. Ring Mail, Scale Mail**: 0 to hit
- **vs. Chain Mail**: 0 to hit
- **vs. Splint Mail, Banded Mail**: +1 to hit
- **vs. Plate Mail, Field Plate, Full Plate**: +2 to hit

### Slashing Weapons vs. Armor

Slashing weapons are generally more effective against lighter, flexible armors, as they can cut through or between the protective elements. They are less effective against rigid armors like plate mail, which can deflect or stop the cutting edge.

- **vs. Padded, Leather, Studded Leather**: +1 to hit
- **vs. Ring Mail, Scale Mail**: +1 to hit
- **vs. Chain Mail**: 0 to hit
- **vs. Splint Mail, Banded Mail**: -1 to hit
- **vs. Plate Mail, Field Plate, Full Plate**: -2 to hit

### Piercing Weapons vs. Armor

Piercing weapons are generally effective against most types of armor, as they can penetrate between links of chain mail or find gaps in plate armor. However, they may have difficulty with certain types of armor designed specifically to resist piercing attacks.

- **vs. Padded, Leather, Studded Leather**: 0 to hit
- **vs. Ring Mail, Scale Mail**: -1 to hit
- **vs. Chain Mail**: +1 to hit
- **vs. Splint Mail, Banded Mail**: 0 to hit
- **vs. Plate Mail, Field Plate, Full Plate**: -1 to hit

## Applying Weapon vs. Armor Type Adjustments

When a character attacks an opponent, the DM should apply the appropriate weapon vs. armor type adjustment to the attack roll. The following guidelines apply:

- **Determine Weapon Type**: Identify the type of weapon being used (bludgeoning, slashing, piercing, or combination).
- **Determine Armor Type**: Identify the type of armor the target is wearing.
- **Apply Adjustment**: Apply the appropriate adjustment to the attack roll. For example, a character attacking with a mace (bludgeoning) against an opponent in plate mail would receive a +2 bonus to their attack roll.
- **Combination Weapons**: For weapons that can be used in multiple ways, the player should specify how they are using the weapon, and the appropriate adjustment should be applied.

## Weapon Speed Factor

In addition to their effectiveness against different types of armor, weapons also have a speed factor that affects initiative in combat. The following guidelines apply:

- **Speed Factor**: Each weapon has a speed factor, typically ranging from 1 (fastest) to 10 (slowest).
- **Initiative Adjustment**: The weapon's speed factor is added to the character's initiative roll, with lower totals acting first.
- **Weapon Length**: Longer weapons may strike first in the initial round of combat, regardless of initiative, if the wielder has room to use the weapon effectively.

## Weapon Reach

The reach of a weapon affects which opponents can be attacked and can provide advantages in certain combat situations:

- **Short Reach**: Weapons like daggers and hand axes can only attack adjacent opponents.
- **Medium Reach**: Weapons like swords and maces can attack adjacent opponents and may provide advantages in certain tactical situations.
- **Long Reach**: Weapons like spears and halberds can attack opponents who are not adjacent, allowing the wielder to strike from a safer distance.

## Weapon Proficiency

A character's proficiency with a weapon affects their ability to use it effectively:

- **Proficient**: Characters who are proficient with a weapon use it without penalty.
- **Non-Proficient**: Characters who are not proficient with a weapon suffer a penalty to their attack rolls when using it. The specific penalty depends on the character's class:
  - Fighters, Paladins, Rangers: -2 to hit
  - Clerics, Druids, Thieves, Assassins, Bards: -3 to hit
  - Magic-Users, Illusionists: -5 to hit

## Conclusion

The type of weapon a character uses and the type of armor their opponent wears are significant factors in combat in the AD&D game. The DM should use these guidelines to handle weapon vs. armor type adjustments in a way that is realistic and consistent, while also considering the specific needs and themes of the campaign.
