# Armor, Armor Class, & Weapons

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, armor, armor class, and weapons are fundamental aspects of combat. This section provides an overview of these elements and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in the campaign.

## Armor

Armor in the AD&D game represents protective gear worn by characters to reduce the likelihood of being injured in combat. The following types of armor are commonly available:

### Light Armor
- **Padded Armor**: Quilted layers of cloth and batting.
- **Leather Armor**: Hardened leather.
- **Studded Leather**: Leather reinforced with metal studs.
- **Ring Mail**: Leather with metal rings sewn onto it.

### Medium Armor
- **Scale Mail**: Overlapping metal scales sewn onto a leather backing.
- **Chain Mail**: Interlocking metal rings.
- **Splint Mail**: Vertical metal strips riveted to a backing.
- **Banded Mail**: Overlapping horizontal metal bands.

### Heavy Armor
- **Plate Mail**: Chain mail with metal plates covering vital areas.
- **Field Plate**: Improved plate mail with better coverage.
- **Full Plate**: Complete metal encasement, custom-fitted to the wearer.

### Shields
- **Small Shield**: A small, round shield strapped to the arm.
- **Medium Shield**: A medium-sized shield that can be used to protect a larger area.
- **Large Shield**: A large shield that provides significant protection but is cumbersome.
- **Tower Shield**: A massive shield that provides excellent protection but severely restricts mobility.

## Armor Class

Armor Class (AC) in the AD&D game represents how difficult it is to hit and damage a character or creature in combat. The following guidelines apply:

- **AC Scale**: Armor Class ranges from 10 (no armor) to -10 (extremely well-protected), with lower numbers representing better protection.
- **Base AC**: A character with no armor and no Dexterity adjustment has an AC of 10.
- **Armor Contribution**: Wearing armor improves (lowers) AC according to the type of armor. For example, leather armor provides AC 8, chain mail provides AC 5, and plate mail provides AC 3.
- **Shield Contribution**: Using a shield improves AC by 1 point.
- **Dexterity Adjustment**: Characters with high Dexterity receive a bonus to AC, while characters with low Dexterity suffer a penalty.
- **Magical Adjustments**: Magical armor and shields provide additional improvements to AC, typically expressed as a plus (e.g., chain mail +1 provides AC 4 instead of the normal AC 5).

## Weapons

Weapons in the AD&D game are tools used by characters to inflict damage in combat. The following categories of weapons are commonly available:

### Melee Weapons
- **Swords**: Includes short swords, long swords, two-handed swords, bastard swords, and others.
- **Axes**: Includes hand axes, battle axes, and great axes.
- **Blunt Weapons**: Includes clubs, maces, hammers, and flails.
- **Polearms**: Includes spears, halberds, pikes, and other long-hafted weapons.
- **Daggers and Knives**: Includes various small bladed weapons.
- **Miscellaneous**: Includes whips, nets, and other unusual melee weapons.

### Missile Weapons
- **Bows**: Includes short bows, long bows, and composite bows.
- **Crossbows**: Includes light crossbows, heavy crossbows, and hand crossbows.
- **Thrown Weapons**: Includes daggers, axes, spears, and other weapons that can be thrown.
- **Slings**: Includes slings and staff slings.
- **Miscellaneous**: Includes blowguns, darts, and other unusual missile weapons.

## Weapon Characteristics

Each weapon in the AD&D game has several characteristics that define its performance in combat:

- **Damage**: The amount of damage the weapon inflicts on a successful hit, typically expressed as a die roll (e.g., 1d8 for a long sword).
- **Speed Factor**: How quickly the weapon can be used, affecting initiative in combat. Lower numbers represent faster weapons.
- **Space Required**: How much space is needed to use the weapon effectively.
- **Length**: The reach of the weapon, affecting which opponents can be attacked.
- **Weight**: The weight of the weapon, affecting encumbrance and who can use it effectively.
- **Type**: Whether the weapon inflicts slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage, which can affect its effectiveness against different types of armor and creatures.

## Weapon vs. Armor Adjustments

In the AD&D game, the effectiveness of different types of weapons varies depending on the type of armor the target is wearing. This is represented by the Weapon vs. Armor Type table, which provides adjustments to the attack roll based on the combination of weapon and armor.

For example, a battle axe might receive a +2 bonus against plate mail but a -1 penalty against leather armor, while a mace might receive a +1 bonus against plate mail and no adjustment against leather armor.

## Magical Weapons and Armor

Magical weapons and armor provide various benefits beyond their normal characteristics:

- **Attack and Damage Bonuses**: Magical weapons typically provide bonuses to attack rolls and damage rolls, expressed as a plus (e.g., a long sword +1 provides a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls).
- **AC Bonuses**: Magical armor and shields typically provide additional improvements to AC, expressed as a plus (e.g., plate mail +1 provides AC 2 instead of the normal AC 3).
- **Special Properties**: Some magical weapons and armor have special properties beyond simple bonuses, such as the ability to harm creatures that are immune to normal weapons, to protect against specific types of attacks, or to provide special abilities to the wearer.

## Class Restrictions on Armor and Weapons

Different character classes have different restrictions on the types of armor and weapons they can use:

- **Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers**: Can use any type of armor and any weapon.
- **Clerics**: Can use any type of armor but are restricted to blunt weapons (no edged or pointed weapons).
- **Druids**: Can use leather armor, studded leather armor, and wooden shields, and are restricted to certain weapons (club, dagger, dart, hammer, scimitar, sling, spear, staff).

## Conclusion
