# Dexterity Armor Class Bonus

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, a character's Dexterity score can provide a bonus (or penalty) to their Armor Class (AC), representing their ability to dodge or evade attacks. This section provides detailed information on how Dexterity affects Armor Class.

## Dexterity and Armor Class

A character's Dexterity score affects their Armor Class according to the following table:

| Dexterity Score | Armor Class Adjustment |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| 3               | +4 (worse)             |
| 4               | +3 (worse)             |
| 5               | +2 (worse)             |
| 6               | +1 (worse)             |
| 7-14            | 0 (no adjustment)      |
| 15              | -1 (better)            |
| 16              | -2 (better)            |
| 17              | -3 (better)            |
| 18              | -4 (better)            |

Remember that in the AD&D game, a lower Armor Class is better, so negative adjustments improve AC while positive adjustments worsen it.

## Applying the Dexterity Bonus

The Dexterity bonus (or penalty) to Armor Class is applied after determining the base AC from armor and shields. The following guidelines apply:

- **Base AC**: Start with the character's base AC from armor and shields. For example, a character wearing chain mail (AC 5) and using a shield (AC improvement of 1) has a base AC of 4.
- **Dexterity Adjustment**: Apply the Dexterity adjustment to the base AC. For example, a character with a Dexterity of 16 (-2 AC adjustment) and a base AC of 4 has a final AC of 2.
- **Magical Adjustments**: Apply any magical adjustments from magical armor or shields after the Dexterity adjustment. For example, a character with a Dexterity of 16 (-2 AC adjustment), wearing chain mail +1 (AC 4) and using a shield +1 (AC improvement of 2) has a final AC of 0.

## Limitations on Dexterity Bonus

The Dexterity bonus to Armor Class may be limited or negated in certain circumstances:

- **Armor Type**: Some types of armor may limit the Dexterity bonus that can be applied. For example, heavy armor like plate mail might limit the Dexterity bonus to a maximum of -1, regardless of the character's actual Dexterity score.
- **Encumbrance**: A heavily encumbered character may have their Dexterity bonus to AC reduced or negated, as their ability to dodge or evade is impaired by the weight they are carrying.
- **Surprise**: A surprised character does not receive their Dexterity bonus to AC during the surprise round, as they are caught unprepared.
- **Immobilization**: An immobilized character (such as one who is paralyzed, held, or otherwise unable to move) does not receive their Dexterity bonus to AC, as they cannot dodge or evade.
- **Unconsciousness**: An unconscious character does not receive their Dexterity bonus to AC, for obvious reasons.

## Dexterity and Missile Attacks

In addition to affecting Armor Class, Dexterity also affects a character's ability to hit with missile weapons. The following table shows the adjustment to attack rolls with missile weapons based on Dexterity:

| Dexterity Score | Missile Attack Adjustment |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| 3               | -3 (worse)                |
| 4-5             | -2 (worse)                |
| 6-7             | -1 (worse)                |
| 8-15            | 0 (no adjustment)         |
| 16              | +1 (better)               |
| 17              | +2 (better)               |
| 18              | +3 (better)               |

This adjustment is applied to the character's attack roll when using missile weapons, such as bows, crossbows, slings, or thrown weapons.

## Dexterity and Initiative

Dexterity also affects a character's initiative in combat. The following table shows the adjustment to initiative rolls based on Dexterity:

| Dexterity Score | Initiative Adjustment |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| 3               | -2 (worse)           |
| 4-6             | -1 (worse)           |
| 7-14            | 0 (no adjustment)    |
| 15-16           | +1 (better)          |
| 17-18           | +2 (better)          |

This adjustment is applied to the character's initiative roll at the beginning of each combat round.

## Dexterity and Thief Abilities

For thief characters, Dexterity affects several of their special abilities. The following table shows the adjustment to thief abilities based on Dexterity:

| Dexterity Score | Pick Pockets | Open Locks | Find/Remove Traps | Move Silently | Hide in Shadows |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 9               | -15%         | -10%       | -10%              | -20%          | -10%            |
| 10              | -10%         | -5%        | -10%              | -15%          | -5%             |
| 11              | -5%          | 0%         | -5%               | -10%          | 0%              |
| 12              | 0%           | 0%         | 0%                | -5%           | 0%              |
| 13              | 0%           | 0%         | 0%                | 0%            | 0%              |
| 14              | 0%           | 0%         | 0%                | 0%            | 0%              |
| 15              | 0%           | +5%        | 0%                | +5%           | 0%              |
| 16              | +5%          | +10%       | 0%                | +10%          | +5%             |
| 17              | +10%         | +15%       | +5%               | +15%          | +10%            |
| 18              | +15%         | +20%       | +10%              | +20%          | +15%            |

These adjustments are applied to the thief's base percentage chance for each ability.

## Conclusion

Dexterity is a crucial ability score for many characters, affecting their Armor Class, missile attacks, initiative, and (for thieves) special abilities. The DM should ensure that Dexterity bonuses and penalties are applied consistently and fairly, while also considering the specific circumstances and limitations that may affect these bonuses.
