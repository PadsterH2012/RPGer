## Armor and Encumbrance

The weight of armor contributes significantly to a character's encumbrance, which affects movement rate and other physical activities. The following guidelines apply:

### Encumbrance Categories

- **Unencumbered**: A character carrying less than 35 pounds (including armor) is considered unencumbered and can move at their full movement rate.
- **Lightly Encumbered**: A character carrying 35-70 pounds is considered lightly encumbered and moves at 3/4 of their normal movement rate.
- **Moderately Encumbered**: A character carrying 71-105 pounds is considered moderately encumbered and moves at 1/2 of their normal movement rate.
- **Heavily Encumbered**: A character carrying 106-150 pounds is considered heavily encumbered and moves at 1/4 of their normal movement rate.
- **Severely Encumbered**: A character carrying 151-300 pounds is considered severely encumbered and moves at 1/10 of their normal movement rate.

### Armor and Movement

The type of armor a character wears directly affects their movement rate, regardless of their total encumbrance:

- **No Armor or Light Armor**: Characters wearing no armor, padded armor, or leather armor can move at their full base movement rate (subject to encumbrance).
- **Medium Armor**: Characters wearing studded leather, ring mail, scale mail, or chain mail move at 3/4 of their base movement rate (subject to encumbrance).
- **Heavy Armor**: Characters wearing splint mail, banded mail, plate mail, field plate, or full plate move at 1/2 of their base movement rate (subject to encumbrance).

### Armor and Dexterity

The type of armor a character wears can also affect their Dexterity and Dexterity-based abilities:

- **No Armor or Light Armor**: No penalty to Dexterity or Dexterity-based abilities.
- **Medium Armor**: -1 penalty to Dexterity for certain fine motor tasks.
- **Heavy Armor**: -2 penalty to Dexterity for certain fine motor tasks and a -10% penalty to thief abilities.

## Donning and Removing Armor

The time required to don (put on) or remove armor depends on the type of armor:

- **Light Armor**: 1 round to don, 1 round to remove.
- **Medium Armor**: 4 rounds to don, 2 rounds to remove.
- **Heavy Armor**: 10 rounds to don, 5 rounds to remove.

These times assume the character has assistance. Without assistance, the time required is doubled.

## Armor and Class Restrictions

Different character classes have different restrictions on the types of armor they can use:

- **Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers**: Can use any type of armor.
- **Clerics**: Can use any type of armor.
- **Druids**: Can use leather armor, studded leather armor, and wooden shields.
- **Magic-Users and Illusionists**: Cannot use armor.
- **Thieves**: Can use leather armor.
- **Assassins**: Can use leather armor, studded leather armor, and chain mail.
- **Monks**: Cannot use armor.
- **Bards**: Can use any armor up to chain mail.

## Armor and Spell Casting

The type of armor a character wears can affect their ability to cast spells:

- **Arcane Spellcasters**: Magic-users and illusionists cannot cast spells while wearing any armor.
- **Divine Spellcasters**: Clerics and druids can cast spells while wearing armor appropriate to their class.
- **Other Spellcasters**: Characters with spell-casting abilities from multiple classes (such as multi-class characters) follow the restrictions of their spellcasting class.

## Armor and Swimming

The type of armor a character wears significantly affects their ability to swim:

- **No Armor**: Characters wearing no armor can swim at 1/2 their normal movement rate.
- **Light Armor**: Characters wearing light armor can swim at 1/3 their normal movement rate.
- **Medium Armor**: Characters wearing medium armor can swim at 1/6 their normal movement rate and must make a Strength check each round to avoid sinking.
- **Heavy Armor**: Characters wearing heavy armor cannot swim and will sink unless they remove their armor or receive magical assistance.

## Armor and Fatigue

The type of armor a character wears can contribute to fatigue during extended physical activity:

- **No Armor or Light Armor**: No significant contribution to fatigue.
- **Medium Armor**: Contributes to fatigue during extended marches or combat.
- **Heavy Armor**: Significantly contributes to fatigue during extended marches or combat.

The DM should consider requiring Constitution checks or imposing penalties for characters engaging in extended physical activity while wearing medium or heavy armor, particularly in hot or humid conditions.

## Conclusion

The type of armor a character wears is a significant decision that affects not only their protection in combat but also their mobility, Dexterity, spell-casting ability, and endurance. The DM should use these guidelines to handle armor and encumbrance in a way that is realistic and consistent, while also considering the specific needs and themes of the campaign.
