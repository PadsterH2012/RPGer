# Casting Spells from Scrolls

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Casting spells from scrolls in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is a special form of spellcasting that allows characters to use magical effects without memorizing or preparing spells. This section provides detailed information on casting spells from scrolls and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling this aspect of magic.

## Basic Procedure

The basic procedure for casting spells from scrolls involves several steps:

1. **Identification**: The character must first identify the spell contained on the scroll, typically through read magic for arcane scrolls or appropriate knowledge for divine scrolls.

2. **Preparation**: The character must prepare to cast the spell by:
   - Unrolling or unfolding the scroll
   - Holding it properly in both hands (unless specified otherwise)
   - Ensuring adequate light to read the writing
   - Meeting any special requirements specified on the scroll

3. **Reading**: The character must read the spell aloud, pronouncing the magical words correctly and with proper cadence.

4. **Targeting**: If the spell requires targeting, the character must designate targets according to the spell's normal rules.

5. **Completion**: As the reading is completed, the magical writing typically fades, burns away, or otherwise disappears as the spell takes effect.

## Who Can Cast from Scrolls

Different types of characters can cast different types of spells from scrolls:

### Arcane Spell Scrolls

- **Magic-Users**: Can cast any magic-user spell from a scroll, provided they can read it (either naturally or through read magic).

- **Illusionists**: Can cast illusionist spells from scrolls and may be able to cast some magic-user spells that overlap with illusionist magic, at the DM's discretion.

- **Thieves**: High-level thieves (typically 10th level or higher) can attempt to cast spells from magic-user scrolls, with a percentage chance of success based on their level and Intelligence.

- **Other Classes**: Generally cannot cast spells from arcane scrolls, though exceptions may exist for specific scrolls or in special circumstances.

### Divine Spell Scrolls

- **Clerics**: Can cast any clerical spell from a scroll appropriate to their alignment and deity.

- **Druids**: Can cast druidic spells from scrolls and may be able to cast some clerical spells that overlap with druidic magic, at the DM's discretion.

- **Paladins**: May be able to cast some clerical spells from scrolls, typically those related to healing or protection, at the DM's discretion.

- **Rangers**: May be able to cast some druidic spells from scrolls at higher levels, at the DM's discretion.

- **Other Classes**: Generally cannot cast spells from divine scrolls, though exceptions may exist for specific scrolls or in special circumstances.

### Protection Scrolls

- **Any Character**: Protection scrolls can typically be used by any character who can read them, regardless of class, though some may have specific requirements or limitations.

## Casting Time

The time required to cast a spell from a scroll varies:

- **Standard Time**: Casting a spell from a scroll typically takes 1 round per spell level, representing the time needed to read and properly pronounce the magical writing.

- **Specified Time**: Some scrolls may specify different casting times, particularly for complex or powerful spells.

- **Protection Scrolls**: Protection scrolls typically take 1 round to activate, regardless of the power of the protection.

- **Emergency Use**: In some cases, the DM may allow faster casting in emergency situations, potentially with an increased risk of failure or mishap.

## Components and Requirements

Casting from scrolls modifies the normal component requirements of spells:

- **Verbal Component**: The reading of the scroll itself serves as the verbal component, replacing the normal verbal components of the spell.

- **Somatic Component**: Holding and manipulating the scroll typically serves as the somatic component, though some scrolls may specify additional gestures.

- **Material Components**: Spells cast from scrolls generally do not require additional material components, as these are effectively incorporated into the scroll itself.

- **Special Requirements**: Some scrolls may specify special requirements for casting, such as:
  - Casting at specific times or under specific conditions
  - Using specific items in conjunction with the scroll
  - Being in specific locations or environments
  - Having specific character attributes or states

## Casting at Higher Levels

Spells cast from scrolls are typically cast at specific levels:

- **Minimum Level**: Most spell scrolls contain spells cast at the minimum level required for the spell, representing the most efficient encoding of the magic.

- **Specified Level**: Some scrolls may specify that the contained spell is cast at a higher level, providing enhanced effects according to the spell's normal rules for casting at higher levels.

- **Caster Level Effects**: Effects that depend on caster level (such as damage dice, duration, or range) typically use either:
  - The minimum level required to cast the spell
  - A specified level indicated on the scroll
  - The level of the scroll's creator (for specially created scrolls)

## Failure and Mishaps

Attempting to cast spells from scrolls can sometimes fail or cause mishaps:

### Conditions for Failure

- **Incomprehension**: If a character cannot properly comprehend the magical writing, either due to lack of read magic or insufficient spellcasting ability.

- **Class Mismatch**: If a character attempts to use a scroll intended for a different class (such as a magic-user trying to use a clerical scroll).

- **Level Disparity**: If a thief or other limited scroll user attempts to cast a spell of too high a level for their ability.

- **Interruption**: If the reading is interrupted by damage, significant distraction, or other interference.

- **Environmental Factors**: If environmental conditions such as darkness, loud noise, or adverse weather interfere with proper reading.

### Types of Failures

- **Simple Failure**: The spell fails to activate, but the scroll is still consumed.

- **Partial Effect**: The spell activates but with reduced, limited, or unpredictable effects.

- **Reversed Effect**: The spell activates with an effect opposite to what was intended.

- **Magical Backlash**: The magical energy rebounds on the caster, causing damage, temporary ability loss, or other negative effects.

- **Magical Mishap**: The magical energy manifests in unpredictable ways, potentially causing random magical effects in the area.

### Failure Determination

- **Thief Scroll Use**: Thieves attempting to use magic-user scrolls have a base chance of success determined by their level and Intelligence, typically ranging from 10% to 85%.

- **Other Unauthorized Use**: Other characters attempting to use scrolls not intended for their class typically have a very low chance of success (5-10%) or automatically fail, at the DM's discretion.

- **Interrupted Casting**: Characters whose scroll casting is interrupted typically must make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid a mishap, with failure resulting in one of the failure types described above.

## Special Considerations

Several special considerations apply to casting spells from scrolls:

### Multiple Spell Scrolls

- **Reading Order**: When a scroll contains multiple spells, they must typically be read in order from top to bottom.

- **Partial Use**: Using one spell from a multiple-spell scroll does not affect the other spells, which remain available for later use.

- **Copying Limitations**: When copying spells from a scroll to a spell book, each spell copied causes that spell to fade from the scroll, but does not affect other spells on the scroll.

### Scroll Conditions

- **Damaged Scrolls**: Scrolls that have been damaged by water, fire, or other hazards may be partially or completely unusable, or may produce unpredictable effects when used.

- **Partial Scrolls**: Fragments of scrolls may contain partial spells that produce limited, unpredictable, or dangerous effects when read.

- **Aged Scrolls**: Very old scrolls may be fragile or faded, requiring special care when handling and potentially having a chance of crumbling or becoming illegible when used.

### Environmental Factors

- **Darkness**: Reading a scroll typically requires adequate light, though some scrolls may be enchanted to glow or be readable in darkness.

- **Underwater**: Reading a scroll underwater is generally impossible without magical assistance, as both the scroll and the verbal components would be compromised.

- **Extreme Conditions**: Extreme environmental conditions such as heavy rain, strong winds, or intense heat may impose penalties on attempts to read scrolls or may damage the scrolls themselves.

## Conclusion

Casting spells from scrolls provides a flexible and valuable magical resource in the AD&D game, allowing characters to access spells they could not otherwise cast or to supplement their normal spellcasting capabilities. The DM should use these guidelines to handle scroll use in a way that is fair, consistent, and reflective of the magical nature of the game world. By understanding the procedures, limitations, and potential complications of casting from scrolls, the DM can create more engaging and balanced magical elements in the campaign.
