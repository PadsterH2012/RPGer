# Spell Research

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Spell research in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is the process by which spellcasters develop new spells or variations of existing spells. This section provides detailed information on spell research and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling this creative aspect of magical characters.

## Purpose of Spell Research

Spell research serves several important purposes in the AD&D game:

- **Character Development**: Spell research allows spellcasting characters to develop unique magical abilities that reflect their interests, needs, and personal style.
- **Campaign Enrichment**: New spells add depth and variety to the campaign, creating unique magical elements that distinguish it from other campaigns.
- **Resource Investment**: Spell research provides a meaningful way for characters to invest time and resources, creating long-term projects beyond immediate adventuring goals.
- **Problem Solving**: Characters can research spells specifically designed to address challenges or threats they face in the campaign.
- **Magical Advancement**: Beyond simply gaining levels, spell research represents a character's growing mastery of magical theory and practice.

## Types of Spell Research

There are several types of spell research:

- **New Spell Creation**: Developing entirely new spells with unique effects not covered by existing spells.
- **Spell Variation**: Creating variations of existing spells with modified ranges, durations, areas of effect, or other parameters.
- **Spell Combination**: Combining elements of multiple existing spells to create new effects.
- **Spell Reversal**: Developing reversed versions of existing spells, creating opposite effects.
- **Spell Adaptation**: Adapting spells from one class or tradition to another, such as converting a magic-user spell to a clerical form.

## Research Requirements

Spell research requires several elements:

### Researcher Qualifications

- **Level Requirement**: The researcher must be of sufficient level to cast spells of the level being researched. Typically, a caster can research spells of levels they can currently cast, though some DMs may allow research of spells one level higher.
- **Ability Scores**: High Intelligence (for arcane spellcasters) or Wisdom (for divine spellcasters) improves the chance of successful research.
- **Knowledge Base**: The researcher should have a solid foundation in magical theory, typically represented by knowing multiple spells of the same level or lower than the spell being researched.
- **Class Restrictions**: The researcher can only research spells appropriate to their class (magic-users cannot research clerical spells, etc.).

### Physical Requirements

- **Laboratory or Workshop**: Arcane spellcasters typically require a laboratory equipped with alchemical equipment, reference materials, and magical tools. The quality of the laboratory affects the chance of success.
- **Sanctified Space**: Divine spellcasters typically require a sanctified space appropriate to their deity or tradition, such as a shrine, altar, or sacred grove.
- **Reference Materials**: Books, scrolls, or other references related to the type of magic being researched improve the chance of success.
- **Components and Materials**: Experimental components and materials, which vary based on the nature of the spell being researched, are consumed during the research process.

### Time and Cost

- **Base Time**: Spell research typically requires 1-4 weeks per spell level, with more complex or powerful spells requiring more time.
- **Base Cost**: Research typically costs 100-1,000 gold pieces per spell level, covering components, materials, reference acquisition, and other expenses.
- **Failure Extension**: Failed research attempts may require additional time and resources to continue the research.
- **Interruption Consequences**: Interrupting research may result in lost progress, wasted resources, or even magical accidents.

## Research Process

The spell research process typically involves several stages:

### Conceptualization

- **Spell Definition**: The researcher defines the desired effect, range, duration, area, and other parameters of the spell.
- **Theoretical Framework**: The researcher develops the theoretical framework for the spell, drawing on existing magical principles and theories.
- **Component Selection**: The researcher identifies potential components that might channel or shape the desired magical energies.
- **Risk Assessment**: The researcher assesses potential risks or side effects of the spell, developing safeguards or limitations.

### Experimentation

- **Component Testing**: The researcher tests various components and combinations to find those that produce the desired magical resonances.
- **Formula Development**: The researcher develops and refines the verbal, somatic, and material components of the spell.
- **Energy Manipulation**: The researcher experiments with different methods of channeling and shaping magical energies.
- **Controlled Testing**: The researcher conducts controlled tests of partial or limited versions of the spell to observe effects and make adjustments.

### Finalization

- **Formula Perfection**: The researcher finalizes the exact verbal, somatic, and material components required for the spell.
- **Energy Stabilization**: The researcher ensures that the magical energies of the spell are stable and controlled.
- **Documentation**: The researcher documents the spell in their spellbook (for arcane spellcasters) or through prayer and meditation (for divine spellcasters).
- **Final Testing**: The researcher performs a final test of the completed spell to confirm its effects and reliability.

## Success Determination

The DM determines the success of spell research based on several factors:

- **Base Chance**: Establish a base chance of success, typically 50% for spells of a level the caster can currently cast, modified by various factors.
- **Level Modifier**: Apply modifiers based on the spell's level relative to the researcher's capabilities, with higher-level spells having lower chances of success.
- **Ability Score Modifier**: Apply modifiers based on the researcher's Intelligence (for arcane spellcasters) or Wisdom (for divine spellcasters).
- **Facility Modifier**: Apply modifiers based on the quality and appropriateness of the research facility.
- **Reference Modifier**: Apply modifiers based on the availability and relevance of reference materials.
- **Time Modifier**: Apply modifiers based on the time invested relative to the standard research time.
- **Similarity Modifier**: Apply modifiers based on the similarity of the new spell to spells the researcher already knows.

## Research Outcomes

Spell research can have various outcomes:

- **Complete Success**: The researcher successfully develops the spell as intended, with reliable and predictable effects.
- **Partial Success**: The researcher develops a version of the spell with limitations, such as reduced range, duration, or effectiveness, or with additional component requirements.
- **Modified Effect**: The researcher develops a spell that produces an effect different from what was intended, but potentially still useful.
- **Temporary Success**: The researcher develops a spell that works initially but proves unstable or unreliable with repeated use.
- **Failure**: The researcher fails to develop a functional spell, wasting the time and resources invested.
- **Catastrophic Failure**: The research goes dramatically wrong, potentially resulting in magical accidents, backlash, or other negative consequences.

## Divine Spell Research

Divine spellcasters (clerics, druids, etc.) have special considerations for spell research:

- **Divine Approval**: Divine spellcasters must receive approval from their deity or divine source for new spells, typically through prayer, meditation, or divination.
- **Alignment Consistency**: New spells must be consistent with the spellcaster's alignment and the ethos of their deity or tradition.
- **Quest Requirements**: Some deities may require the completion of specific quests or services before granting new spells.
- **Divine Inspiration**: Divine spellcasters may receive inspiration or guidance for new spells through dreams, visions, or direct communication from their deity.
- **Sphere Limitations**: New divine spells must fall within the appropriate spheres of influence for the spellcaster's deity or tradition.

## Collaborative Research

Multiple spellcasters can collaborate on research:

- **Complementary Knowledge**: Collaborators with different specialties or knowledge bases can improve the chance of success.
- **Resource Sharing**: Collaborators can share the cost and resource requirements of research.
- **Time Efficiency**: Collaboration may reduce the time required for research, though typically not proportionally to the number of researchers.
- **Risk Distribution**: Collaborators may share the risks of research, potentially reducing the consequences of failures for any individual.
- **Ownership Considerations**: Collaborators must agree on ownership and usage rights for the resulting spell.

## Spell Balance Considerations

The DM should consider several factors when evaluating proposed new spells:

- **Power Level**: The spell's power should be appropriate for its level, comparable to existing spells of the same level.
- **Versatility**: Highly versatile spells should generally be higher level than more specialized spells of similar power.
- **Component Requirements**: More powerful spells should typically have more significant component requirements, particularly for material components.
- **Casting Time**: More powerful spells should typically have longer casting times, creating tactical limitations.
- **Risk Factors**: Powerful spells may include risk factors or potential backfire effects that limit their casual use.
- **Campaign Impact**: Consider how the new spell might affect the campaign, including its potential interactions with existing challenges, NPCs, or plot elements.

## Example Research Projects

The following are examples of spell research projects:

- **Elemental Variation**: Researching a variation of fireball that uses a different element, such as ice or acid, potentially with modified damage type and secondary effects.
- **Duration Extension**: Researching a version of invisibility that lasts longer but has additional component requirements or limitations.
- **Target Expansion**: Researching a version of charm person that affects multiple targets but at reduced duration or with higher-level components.
- **Effect Combination**: Researching a spell that combines the effects of fly and invisibility at a higher spell level with significant component requirements.
- **Specialized Protection**: Researching a protection spell specifically designed to counter a particular threat the characters face in the campaign.

## Conclusion

Spell research is a creative and rewarding aspect of the AD&D game, allowing spellcasting characters to develop unique magical abilities while investing time and resources in long-term projects. The DM should use these guidelines to handle spell research in a way that is balanced, engaging, and integrated with the campaign world. By understanding the requirements, process, and potential outcomes of spell research, the DM can create meaningful opportunities for magical characters to express their creativity and expand their capabilities beyond the standard spell lists.
