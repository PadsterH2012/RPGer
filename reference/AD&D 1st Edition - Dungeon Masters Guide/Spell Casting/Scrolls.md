# Scrolls

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Scrolls in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are magical writings on parchment, paper, or other materials that contain spells or other magical effects that can be activated by reading them aloud. This section provides detailed information on scrolls and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling these versatile magical items.

## Nature of Scrolls

Scrolls have the following characteristics:

- **Physical Form**: Scrolls are typically sheets of parchment, papyrus, or similar materials, often rolled into cylinders and stored in protective cases.
- **Magical Writing**: Scrolls contain magical writing that embodies the spell or effect, written in special inks often containing magical ingredients.
- **One-Time Use**: Most scrolls are consumed when used, with the magical writing fading or burning away as the magic is released.
- **Portable Magic**: Scrolls provide a way to carry and use magic without memorizing spells or using spell slots, making them valuable resources for all characters.
- **Varied Origins**: Scrolls can be created by spellcasters, found as treasure, purchased from magical suppliers, or acquired as rewards or gifts.

There are several types of scrolls in the AD&D game:

### Spell Scrolls

- **Clerical Scrolls**: Contain divine spells that can be cast by clerics or other divine spellcasters.
- **Druidic Scrolls**: Contain nature-oriented divine spells that can be cast by druids.
- **Illusionist Scrolls**: Contain illusion-focused arcane spells that can be cast by illusionists.
- **Mixed Scrolls**: Contain spells from multiple traditions, requiring different types of spellcasters to use different spells on the scroll.

### Protection Scrolls

- **Ritual Scrolls**: Contain complex magical rituals that require specific conditions or components to activate.
- **Unique Scrolls**: Contain unique or legendary magic with effects not easily categorized.

## Scroll Creation

The creation of scrolls involves several elements:

### Creator Requirements

- **Spellcasting Ability**: The creator must be able to cast the spell being inscribed on the scroll.
- **Level**: The creator must be of sufficient level to cast the spell normally.
- **Knowledge**: The creator must know the spell being inscribed, either through their spell book, divine granting, or other means.
- **Materials**: The creator must have appropriate materials, including special inks, quills, and high-quality writing surfaces.

### Creation Process

- **Preparation**: The creator prepares special inks, often containing magical ingredients such as powdered gems, rare herbs, or monster parts.
- **Inscription**: The creator inscribes the spell using precise magical formulae, incorporating verbal and somatic components into written form.
- **Binding**: The creator binds the magical energy into the writing, creating a stable but activatable magical effect.
- **Finishing**: The creator adds any final touches, such as protective cases, seals, or labels.

### Time and Cost

- **Time**: Creating a scroll typically takes 1 day per spell level, with protection scrolls and special scrolls potentially taking longer.
- **Cost**: Creating a scroll typically costs 100 gold pieces per spell level, covering materials and other expenses.
- **Energy**: Creating a scroll may require the expenditure of personal energy, such as temporary inability to cast the inscribed spell until after a period of rest.

## Using Scrolls

The use of scrolls involves several considerations:

### Reading Requirements

- **Literacy**: The reader must be able to read the language or magical script used on the scroll.
- **Magical Comprehension**: For spell scrolls, the reader must be able to comprehend the magical writing, which typically requires:
  - For arcane scrolls: Being an arcane spellcaster or using read magic
  - For divine scrolls: Being a divine spellcaster of the appropriate type
- **Class Restrictions**: Different types of scrolls have different class restrictions:
  - Magic-user scrolls can be used by magic-users, illusionists (with some restrictions), and sometimes thieves of high level
  - Clerical scrolls can be used by clerics and sometimes paladins
  - Druidic scrolls can be used by druids and sometimes rangers
  - Protection scrolls can typically be used by any character who can read them

### Activation Procedure

- **Holding**: The scroll must be held in the reader's hands and clearly visible to them.
- **Reading Aloud**: The magical writing must be read aloud, with proper pronunciation and cadence.
- **Casting Time**: Reading a scroll typically takes 1 round per spell level, though some scrolls may specify different times.
- **Concentration**: The reader must maintain concentration while reading, with interruptions potentially disrupting the process.
- **Consumption**: Most scrolls are consumed upon use, with the writing fading, burning away, or otherwise disappearing as the magic is released.

### Effects and Limitations

- **Spell Level**: Spells cast from scrolls are typically at the minimum level required to cast the spell, though some scrolls may specify higher levels.
- **Casting Parameters**: Spells cast from scrolls use the standard range, duration, area of effect, and other parameters, unless the scroll specifies otherwise.
- **Saving Throws**: Spells cast from scrolls allow saving throws as normal, unless the scroll specifies otherwise.
- **Casting Failure**: If a character attempts to use a scroll beyond their comprehension or ability, various negative effects may occur:
  - Spell failure with no effect
  - Reversed or twisted effects
  - Magical backlash affecting the reader
  - Summoning of hostile creatures
  - Other unpredictable magical mishaps

## Scroll Identification

Identifying scrolls can be challenging:

- **Visual Examination**: Visual examination can reveal general characteristics such as the type of writing, quality of materials, and presence of symbols or seals, but typically not the specific contents.
- **Magical Detection**: Detect magic can reveal that a scroll is magical but not its specific properties.
- **Read Magic**: The read magic spell allows arcane spellcasters to read and identify arcane scrolls.
- **Divine Insight**: Divine spellcasters can typically identify divine scrolls of their tradition through prayer or meditation.
- **Identify Spell**: The identify spell can reveal the properties of a scroll, though it has limitations and costs.
- **Partial Reading**: Carefully reading just the beginning of a scroll may provide clues to its nature without activating it, though this carries risks of accidental activation.

## Scroll Protection and Storage

Scrolls require proper protection and storage:

- **Scroll Cases**: Scrolls are typically stored in protective cases made of leather, wood, bone, or metal, which protect them from physical damage and environmental factors.
- **Waterproofing**: Many scrolls are treated with waterproofing agents or spells to prevent damage from moisture.
- **Fire Resistance**: Some scrolls are treated with fire-resistant materials or spells, particularly those containing fire-based magic.
- **Magical Protection**: Valuable or dangerous scrolls may have additional magical protections, such as seals that prevent unauthorized reading or wards that activate if the scroll is mishandled.
- **Environmental Considerations**: Scrolls should be stored in dry, moderate-temperature environments, away from direct sunlight, moisture, or extreme conditions.

## Scrolls as Treasure

Scrolls make interesting and useful treasure items:

- **Frequency**: Scrolls are relatively common magical treasures, often found in the possession of spellcasters, in libraries, or in treasure hoards.
- **Value**: The value of a scroll depends on the level and rarity of the spells or effects it contains, typically ranging from 100 to 10,000 gold pieces.
- **Utility**: Scrolls provide utility to a wide range of characters, making them versatile treasure items that most parties can use in some way.
- **Consumable Nature**: As consumable items, scrolls provide temporary power boosts without permanently increasing character capabilities, making them balanced treasure items.
- **Strategic Choices**: Scrolls create interesting strategic choices for players, who must decide when and how to use these one-time resources.

## Conclusion

Scrolls are versatile and valuable magical items in the AD&D game, providing portable, one-time magical effects that can be used by various characters. The DM should use scrolls thoughtfully as treasure, rewards, and plot elements, considering their utility, value, and impact on game balance. By understanding the nature, creation, and use of scrolls, the DM can create more interesting and balanced magical elements in the campaign world.
