# Magical Items

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Magical items in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are objects imbued with magical properties that provide special abilities or effects to their users. This section provides detailed information on magical items and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on creating, placing, and managing these powerful treasures in the campaign.

## Types of Magical Items

There are several categories of magical items in the AD&D game:

- **Potions**: Magical liquids that provide temporary effects when consumed, such as healing, invisibility, or flight.
- **Scrolls**: Magical writings that allow one-time casting of spells or provide other magical effects when read aloud.
- **Rings**: Magical jewelry worn on fingers that provide continuous effects while worn, such as protection, invisibility, or spell storing.
- **Rods, Staves, and Wands**: Magical implements that can cast spells or produce other effects, typically with a limited number of charges.
- **Weapons**: Magical armaments that provide bonuses to attack and damage rolls, and may have additional special properties.
- **Armor and Shields**: Magical protective gear that provides enhanced protection and may have additional special properties.
- **Miscellaneous Magic Items**: A diverse category including magical clothing, jewelry (other than rings), tools, and other objects with various effects.
- **Artifacts and Relics**: Unique, extremely powerful magic items with multiple abilities and significant roles in the campaign world.

## Creating Magical Items

The creation of magical items is a complex and resource-intensive process:

### Creator Requirements

- **Level**: Creating magical items typically requires a spellcaster of significant level, usually 9th level or higher, with higher-level items requiring higher-level creators.
- **Spells**: The creator must know or have access to spells related to the item's effects. For example, creating a wand of fireballs requires the ability to cast the fireball spell.
- **Facilities**: The creator needs appropriate facilities, such as a laboratory, forge, or sanctified space, depending on the type of item being created.
- **Knowledge**: The creator needs knowledge of the specific formulas, rituals, or techniques required for the type of item being created.

### Creation Process

- **Research**: The creator researches the necessary formulas, rituals, or techniques, which may involve consulting rare texts, experimenting, or seeking guidance from other spellcasters.
- **Material Gathering**: The creator gathers the necessary materials, which may include rare or exotic components, specially prepared substances, or items with inherent magical properties.
- **Preparation**: The creator prepares the base item, which must typically be of exceptional quality and may require special treatments or preparations.
- **Enchantment**: The creator performs the enchantment process, which may involve casting specific spells, performing rituals, or using specialized techniques over an extended period.
- **Binding**: The creator binds the magical energies to the item, stabilizing and finalizing the enchantment.

### Time and Cost

- **Base Time**: Creating magical items typically requires 1 day per 1,000 gold pieces of the item's value, with more powerful items requiring more time.
- **Base Cost**: The cost of creating a magical item is typically 50% of its market value, covering materials, components, and other expenses.
- **Energy Expenditure**: Creating magical items often requires the expenditure of personal energy, such as the permanent loss of Constitution points, the temporary inability to cast certain spells, or other sacrifices.
- **Assistance**: Multiple spellcasters can collaborate on item creation, potentially reducing the time required or sharing the energy expenditure, though this typically requires all participants to meet the necessary requirements.

## Identifying Magical Items

Magical items must typically be identified to determine their properties:

- **Detection**: The detect magic spell can reveal that an item is magical but does not identify its specific properties.
- **Identification Spells**: The identify spell can reveal the properties of magical items, though it has limitations and costs in terms of material components and temporary Constitution loss.
- **Experimentation**: Characters can attempt to determine an item's properties through experimentation, though this can be risky with potentially harmful items.
- **Research**: Characters can research magical items in libraries or consult with sages or other knowledgeable individuals to learn about their properties.
- **Legend Lore**: The legend lore spell can provide information about particularly powerful or significant magical items.
- **Partial Identification**: Some properties of magical items may become apparent through use, while others remain hidden until properly identified.

## Using Magical Items

The use of magical items involves several considerations:

- **Activation**: Different magical items are activated in different ways, such as wearing them, speaking command words, performing specific actions, or expending charges.
- **Attunement**: Some magical items require a period of attunement or familiarization before their powers can be used, typically 1-8 hours of possession and concentration.
- **Class Restrictions**: Some magical items can only be used by specific character classes, with attempts by other classes resulting in failure or potentially harmful effects.
- **Alignment Restrictions**: Some magical items can only be used by characters of specific alignments, with attempts by characters of other alignments resulting in failure or potentially harmful effects.
- **Charges**: Many magical items, particularly wands, staves, and certain miscellaneous items, have a limited number of charges that are expended when the item is used.
- **Recharging**: Some items with charges can be recharged through specific processes, while others become non-magical once all charges are expended.

## Cursed Items

Some magical items are cursed, providing negative effects rather than benefits:

- **Disguise**: Cursed items typically appear to be beneficial items when detected or identified, with their true nature becoming apparent only after they are used or equipped.
- **Attachment**: Once a cursed item is used or equipped, it typically cannot be discarded without the use of specific spells such as remove curse.
- **Effects**: Cursed items can have various negative effects, such as penalties to abilities or saving throws, attraction of monsters, personality changes, or transformation of the user.
- **Removal**: Removing a cursed item typically requires a remove curse spell cast by a spellcaster of appropriate level, though some particularly powerful cursed items may require more complex solutions.
- **Dual Nature**: Some cursed items have both beneficial and harmful properties, creating interesting trade-offs for characters who use them.

## Intelligent Items

Some magical items, particularly weapons, may be intelligent:

- **Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma**: Intelligent items have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores that determine their mental capabilities and personality.
- **Communication**: Intelligent items can communicate with their users through various means, such as telepathy, speech, or empathic impressions.
- **Alignment**: Intelligent items have alignments that may conflict with those of their users, potentially leading to conflicts or even attempts by the item to control the user.
- **Powers**: Intelligent items typically have special powers beyond those of normal magical items, which they may use independently or grant to their users.
- **Ego**: Intelligent items have an Ego score that represents their force of personality. When an item's Ego exceeds the user's Wisdom or Charisma, the item may attempt to control the user or refuse to function.

## Artifacts and Relics

The most powerful magical items are artifacts and relics:

- **Unique Nature**: Artifacts and relics are unique items with specific histories, purposes, and roles in the campaign world.
- **Multiple Powers**: Artifacts and relics typically have multiple powers, often far beyond those of standard magical items.
- **Drawbacks**: Artifacts and relics typically have significant drawbacks or costs associated with their use, such as ability score penalties, attraction of powerful enemies, or corruption of the user.
- **Indestructibility**: Artifacts and relics are typically indestructible by normal means, requiring specific and often difficult methods to destroy.
- **Campaign Impact**: The presence of artifacts and relics can significantly impact a campaign, potentially becoming the focus of quests, conflicts, or major storylines.

## Placing Magical Items

The DM should consider the following factors when placing magical items in the campaign:

- **Appropriateness**: Magical items should be appropriate to their location and the monsters or NPCs that possess them. A tribe of goblins might have a few minor magical items, while a dragon's hoard might contain several significant ones.
- **Balance**: The overall number and power of magical items should be balanced to maintain challenge and interest in the campaign. Too many powerful items can make challenges too easy, while too few can make certain obstacles nearly impossible.
- **Uniqueness**: Particularly powerful or significant magical items should be unique or rare, with histories, reputations, and perhaps even names that make them special within the campaign world.
- **Integration**: Magical items can be integrated into the campaign's stories and themes, serving as plot devices, quest objectives, or symbols of power and authority.
- **Logical Distribution**: Magical items should be distributed logically within the campaign world, with more powerful items in the possession of more powerful beings or in more dangerous and remote locations.

## Managing Magical Items

The DM should consider the following factors when managing magical items in the campaign:

- **Item Knowledge**: Determine how much information to provide about magical items when they are found, balancing the excitement of discovery with the challenge of identification.
- **Item Limitations**: Enforce the limitations of magical items, such as charges, activation requirements, and class or alignment restrictions, to maintain game balance and create interesting challenges.
- **Item Maintenance**: Consider whether magical items require maintenance, such as periodic recharging, cleansing, or other care, to remain functional.
- **Item Loss**: Be prepared to handle the loss or destruction of magical items, whether through character death, theft, or other means, in a way that is fair but maintains consequences for carelessness.
- **Item Creation**: Establish clear guidelines for character creation of magical items, including time, cost, and other requirements, to provide meaningful opportunities without unbalancing the game.

## Conclusion

Magical items are a distinctive and exciting aspect of the AD&D game, providing characters with enhanced abilities and special powers while also serving as rewards, plot devices, and sources of wonder. The DM should use magical items thoughtfully to enhance the campaign, considering their placement, properties, and impact on game balance and storytelling. By understanding the different types of magical items and their roles in the game, the DM can create a magical environment that is both mechanically interesting and thematically rich.
