# Spell Casting

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Spell casting in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is the process by which magic-users, clerics, druids, and other spellcasting classes harness magical energies to produce specific effects. This section provides detailed information on spell casting and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling this complex aspect of the game.

## Nature of Magic

Magic in the AD&D game has the following characteristics:

- **Formulaic Structure**: Magic follows specific formulas and patterns that must be precisely executed to achieve the desired effect.
- **Energy Manipulation**: Spellcasters manipulate magical energies that exist in the world, channeling them through specific formulas to create effects.
- **Mental Discipline**: Casting spells requires significant mental discipline and concentration, with interruptions potentially disrupting the process.
- **Physical Components**: Most spells require physical components such as specific gestures, spoken words, and material items.
- **Varied Sources**: Different types of spellcasters draw on different sources of magical power, such as arcane knowledge, divine favor, or natural forces.

## Types of Spellcasters

There are several types of spellcasters in the AD&D game:

- **Magic-Users**: Arcane spellcasters who learn magic through study and practice, mastering complex formulas and theories to manipulate magical energies.
- **Clerics**: Divine spellcasters who receive their magical abilities through devotion to a deity or cosmic force, channeling divine power through prayer and faith.
- **Druids**: Nature-oriented divine spellcasters who draw power from the natural world, using it to control elements, affect plants and animals, and maintain natural balance.
- **Illusionists**: Specialized arcane spellcasters who focus on magic that affects perception and creates false sensory impressions.
- **Rangers**: Warriors with limited spellcasting abilities drawn from both druidic and magic-user traditions, focusing on nature and tracking.
- **Paladins**: Holy warriors with limited divine spellcasting abilities similar to clerics, granted through their devotion and righteousness.
- **Bards**: Versatile characters with limited spellcasting abilities drawn from both arcane and druidic traditions, channeled through music and performance.

## Spell Components

Most spells require specific components to cast:

- **Verbal Components (V)**: Specific words, chants, or sounds that must be spoken aloud during casting. Verbal components cannot be used if the caster is silenced, gagged, or in an area of magical silence.
- **Somatic Components (S)**: Specific hand gestures or body movements that must be performed during casting. Somatic components cannot be performed if the caster is physically restrained or wearing armor that significantly restricts movement (for arcane spellcasters).
- **Material Components (M)**: Physical substances or objects that are consumed or used during casting. Material components must be held or manipulated by the caster and are typically consumed in the casting process, though some spells specify that the components are not consumed.
- **Focus Items**: Similar to material components but not consumed during casting, serving instead as focal points for magical energies.
- **Divine Focus**: For clerics and druids, a holy symbol or other representation of their deity or beliefs, which serves as a focus for their divine magic.

## Spell Preparation and Memorization

Different types of spellcasters prepare spells in different ways:

- **Magic-Users and Illusionists**: Must study their spellbooks to memorize specific spells, a process that typically takes 15 minutes per spell level. Once cast, a memorized spell is erased from the caster's mind and must be re-memorized to be cast again.
- **Clerics and Druids**: Must pray for their spells, a process that typically takes an hour. They do not memorize specific spells but rather prepare spell slots that can be filled with any spell of the appropriate level that they know.
- **Rangers and Paladins**: Prepare spells similarly to clerics and druids, through prayer and meditation.
- **Bards**: Prepare spells similarly to magic-users, though with a more limited selection.

## Spell Casting Time

The time required to cast a spell varies:

- **Segments**: Casting time is measured in segments, with each segment representing 1/10 of a combat round (approximately 6 seconds).
- **Rounds**: Some spells take one or more full rounds to cast, with the effect occurring at the end of the final round.
- **Turns**: Some spells take one or more turns (10 minutes) to cast, typically used for more complex or powerful magic.
- **Hours**: Some spells, particularly rituals or powerful magic, may take hours to cast.
- **Special**: Some spells have special casting time requirements, such as specific times of day or specific celestial alignments.

## Spell Disruption

Spell casting can be disrupted in various ways:

- **Taking Damage**: If a spellcaster takes damage during the casting of a spell, the spell is typically disrupted and lost.
- **Physical Interference**: If a spellcaster is physically interfered with during casting, such as being grappled, pushed, or having their components stolen, the spell may be disrupted.
- **Magical Interference**: Certain magical effects, such as silence for spells with verbal components or anti-magic fields, can prevent spell casting or disrupt spells in progress.
- **Environmental Factors**: Extreme environmental conditions, such as high winds for spells with material components or underwater conditions for spells with verbal components, can make spell casting difficult or impossible.
- **Concentration Checks**: In some situations, the DM may allow a spellcaster to make a concentration check (typically based on Intelligence or Wisdom) to maintain a spell despite disruption, particularly for minor distractions.

## Spell Targeting

Targeting spells involves several considerations:

- **Line of Sight**: Many spells require the caster to see the target. Obstacles, darkness, invisibility, or other visual impediments can prevent targeting.
- **Line of Effect**: Some spells require a clear path from the caster to the target, not just visual contact. Physical barriers can block line of effect even if the target is visible.
- **Range**: Each spell has a range, beyond which it cannot be targeted. Range is typically expressed in inches, with each inch representing 10 feet indoors or 10 yards outdoors.
- **Area of Effect**: Spells with areas of effect, such as fireballs or lightning bolts, affect all targets within the specified area. The DM must determine which creatures or objects fall within the area.
- **Moving Targets**: Targeting moving creatures with spells can be challenging, particularly for spells with longer casting times. The DM may impose penalties or require attack rolls for spells targeted at fast-moving creatures.

## Saving Throws Against Spells

Many spells allow targets to make saving throws to resist or reduce their effects:

- **Types of Saving Throws**: Depending on the nature of the spell, targets may make saving throws vs. petrification/polymorph, rod/staff/wand, breath weapon, spell, or poison.
- **Success Effects**: Successful saving throws typically either negate the spell's effect entirely or reduce it by half (usually for damage-dealing spells).
- **Modifiers**: Various factors can modify saving throws, including the target's level or hit dice, magical protections, and specific resistances or vulnerabilities.
- **Voluntary Failure**: Willing targets may choose to fail their saving throws, allowing beneficial spells to affect them more easily.
- **Special Cases**: Some spells have unique saving throw mechanics or effects on a successful save, as specified in their descriptions.

## Spell Research and Creation

Spellcasters can research and create new spells:

- **Research Requirements**: Spell research typically requires a laboratory or workshop, reference materials, components for experimentation, and significant time and money.
- **Research Process**: The research process involves developing the spell's theory, testing components and formulas, and finally perfecting the casting method.
- **Success Chance**: The chance of successfully researching a new spell depends on the caster's level, Intelligence (for arcane spellcasters) or Wisdom (for divine spellcasters), the spell's level, and its similarity to existing spells.
- **Time and Cost**: Research typically takes 1-4 weeks per spell level and costs 100-1,000 gold pieces per spell level, with more complex or powerful spells requiring more time and resources.
- **DM Approval**: New spells must be approved by the DM, who ensures they are balanced and appropriate for the campaign.

## Spell Books

Magic-users and illusionists record their spells in spell books:

- **Contents**: A standard spell book contains 100 pages, with each spell requiring 1 page per spell level (e.g., a 3rd-level spell requires 3 pages).
- **Protection**: Spell books are often protected with locks, traps, or magical wards to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Replacement**: Lost or destroyed spell books are difficult and expensive to replace, requiring the caster to find new copies of their spells or research them anew.
- **Reading**: Reading another caster's spell book is difficult and may require read magic or similar magic to decipher the unique notations and formulas.
- **Copying**: Copying spells from one book to another requires time (1-2 days per spell level) and resources (100-500 gold pieces per spell level).

## Divine Spell Considerations

Divine spellcasters (clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers) have special considerations:

- **Deity Relationship**: A cleric's relationship with their deity affects their spellcasting, with displeasing the deity potentially resulting in spell limitations or loss.
- **Alignment Consistency**: Divine spellcasters must maintain alignment consistency with their deity or divine source, with significant deviations potentially resulting in spell limitations or loss.
- **Holy Symbol**: Divine spellcasters typically require a holy symbol to cast spells, which serves as a focus for their divine power.
- **Prayer Time**: Divine spellcasters must spend specific times in prayer to prepare their spells, typically at dawn for clerics and at specific times based on natural cycles for druids.
- **Spell Granting**: Divine spells are granted by the deity or divine source rather than learned through study, with the deity potentially withholding specific spells for various reasons.

## Conclusion

Spell casting is a complex and powerful aspect of the AD&D game, providing spellcasting characters with a wide range of abilities beyond physical combat. The DM should use these guidelines to handle spell casting in a way that is fair, consistent, and reflective of the magical nature of the game world. By understanding the procedures, limitations, and special considerations of different types of spell casting, the DM can create more engaging and balanced encounters that allow spellcasters to shine while maintaining appropriate challenges.
