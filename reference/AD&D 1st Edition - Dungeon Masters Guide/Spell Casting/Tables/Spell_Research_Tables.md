# Spell Research Tables

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

This file contains the tables related to spell research as referenced in the Spell Research content file.

## Table 1: Spell Research Base Success Chance

*Table SR-1: Base Chance of Successful Spell Research*

| Spell Level | Base Success Chance |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 1st         | 60%                 |
| 2nd         | 50%                 |
| 3rd         | 40%                 |
| 4th         | 30%                 |
| 5th         | 20%                 |
| 6th         | 15%                 |
| 7th         | 10%                 |
| 8th         | 5%                  |
| 9th         | 3%                  |

**Table Notes:**
- This represents the base chance before any modifiers are applied
- Success chance is checked after the full research time and cost have been expended
- Failure does not necessarily mean the research cannot be continued with additional time and resources

## Table 2: Spell Research Modifiers

*Table SR-2: Modifiers to Spell Research Success Chance*

| Factor                                          | Modifier        |

| **Time Investment**                             |                 |
| Minimum research time                           | No modifier     |
| 50% additional research time                    | +5%             |
| Double research time                            | +10%            |
| Triple research time                            | +15%            |
| **Spell Similarity**                            |                 |
| Completely new effect                           | -15%            |
| Variation of known spell                        | +5%             |

| **Assistance**                                  |                 |
| Per assistant of same class (max 3)             | +5%             |

**Table Notes:**
- All modifiers are cumulative
- Maximum total success chance cannot exceed 95%
- Minimum total success chance cannot be below 1%
- Assistants must be at least half the level of the primary researcher

## Table 3: Spell Research Outcomes

*Table SR-3: Research Outcome by Degree of Success/Failure*

| Roll vs. Success Chance | Outcome                                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Roll ≤ 1/4 of target    | **Exceptional Success**: Spell works perfectly with reduced casting time or components |
| Roll ≤ 1/2 of target    | **Strong Success**: Spell works perfectly as designed                        |
| Roll ≤ target           | **Success**: Spell works as designed with minor limitations                  |
| Roll ≤ target +10%      | **Partial Success**: Spell works with significant limitations                |
| Roll ≤ target +20%      | **Minor Failure**: Research yields insights but no functional spell yet      |
| Roll ≤ target +30%      | **Failure**: Research reaches dead end, must start over with new approach    |
| Roll > target +30%      | **Catastrophic Failure**: Magical accident, possible damage to researcher and facilities |

**Table Notes:**
- "Target" refers to the modified success chance from Tables 1 and 2
- For Partial Success, limitations might include: reduced range, duration, or effect; additional components; longer casting time
- Catastrophic Failure requires a saving throw vs. spells to avoid damage
- Minor and Partial failures allow continued research with additional time and resources

## Table 4: Spell Research Time and Cost

*Table SR-4: Base Research Time and Cost by Spell Level*

| Spell Level | Research Time | Base Cost (gp) |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1st         | 1 week        | 1,000          |
| 2nd         | 2 weeks       | 2,000          |
| 3rd         | 4 weeks       | 4,000          |
| 4th         | 8 weeks       | 8,000          |
| 5th         | 16 weeks      | 16,000         |
| 6th         | 24 weeks      | 24,000         |
| 7th         | 36 weeks      | 36,000         |
| 8th         | 48 weeks      | 48,000         |
| 9th         | 64 weeks      | 64,000         |

**Table Notes:**
- Time and cost assume average quality facilities and standard reference materials
- Poor facilities may increase time by 50%
- Excellent facilities may decrease time by 25%
- Costs may be reduced by up to 50% if the researcher can personally gather rare components
- Research must be conducted in periods of at least 8 consecutive hours per day
