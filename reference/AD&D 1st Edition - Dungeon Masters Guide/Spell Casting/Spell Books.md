# Spell Books

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Spell books in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are the repositories of arcane knowledge that magic-users and illusionists use to record, study, and prepare their spells. This section provides detailed information on spell books and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling these essential tools of arcane spellcasters.

## Nature of Spell Books

Spell books have the following characteristics:

- **Physical Form**: Spell books are typically large, heavy tomes bound in leather or other durable materials, with metal clasps, locks, or other protective features.
- **Personal Creation**: Each spell book is personally created by its owner, using a system of notation, symbols, and formulae that reflect the spellcaster's unique understanding of magical theory.
- **Magical Nature**: Spell books often have inherent magical properties due to the spells recorded within them, even without specific enchantments being placed upon them.
- **Valuable Resource**: Spell books represent a significant investment of time, money, and knowledge, making them among a magic-user's most prized and protected possessions.
- **Practical Necessity**: Arcane spellcasters cannot prepare spells without studying their spell books, making them essential tools rather than optional references.

## Spell Book Construction

The creation and maintenance of spell books involves several considerations:

- **Materials**: Spell books require high-quality materials, including:
  - Parchment or vellum pages, typically treated with alchemical solutions to resist damage and decay
  - Durable binding materials such as leather, often from exotic or magical creatures
  - Inks made with special ingredients, sometimes including powdered gems or magical substances
  - Metal fittings, clasps, and locks to protect and secure the contents

- **Size and Weight**: A standard spell book has the following characteristics:
  - 100 pages (50 leaves)
  - Approximately 12" × 6" × 2" in size
  - Weighs approximately 5 pounds
  - Alternative forms may exist, such as smaller traveling spell books or larger reference tomes

- **Cost**: Creating a new spell book typically costs 100-1,000 gold pieces, depending on the quality of materials used and any special features incorporated.

- **Time**: Creating a new spell book typically takes 1-4 weeks, not including the time required to transcribe spells into it.

## Spell Recording

Spells are recorded in spell books according to specific procedures:

- **Space Requirements**: Each spell requires a number of pages equal to its level (e.g., a 3rd-level spell requires 3 pages).

- **Transcription Process**: Transcribing a spell into a spell book involves:
  - Studying the spell from another source (another spell book, a scroll, or through research)
  - Creating precise diagrams, formulae, and notations that represent the spell's structure
  - Incorporating personal mnemonic devices and reference systems
  - Testing and refining the notation to ensure it will allow proper memorization

- **Time Requirements**: Transcribing a spell typically takes 1 day per spell level, requiring concentrated effort and precision.

- **Cost**: Transcribing a spell typically costs 100 gold pieces per spell level, covering special inks, reagents for testing, and other materials.

- **Comprehension Limitations**: A magic-user can only transcribe spells they can comprehend, which is typically limited by their level and Intelligence.

## Spell Book Capacity

The capacity of spell books is an important consideration:

- **Standard Capacity**: A standard 100-page spell book can contain:
  - 100 levels of spells (e.g., 100 1st-level spells, 50 2nd-level spells, 33 3rd-level spells, etc.)
  - Typically a mix of different spell levels, based on the spellcaster's needs and preferences

- **Organization**: Spellcasters typically organize their spell books in various ways:
  - By spell level, keeping all spells of the same level together
  - By spell type or school, grouping similar spells together
  - By frequency of use, keeping commonly used spells in easily accessible locations
  - By personal classification systems unique to the individual spellcaster

- **Multiple Books**: Most experienced magic-users maintain multiple spell books:
  - A traveling spell book containing frequently used spells
  - One or more reference spell books kept in secure locations
  - Specialized spell books focused on particular types of magic
  - Backup copies of important spells

## Spell Book Protection

Spell books are typically protected through various means:

- **Physical Protection**:
  - Locks, often with poison needles or other traps
  - Water-resistant and fire-resistant treatments
  - Durable bindings and protective cases
  - Hidden compartments or false covers

- **Magical Protection**:
  - Aversion spells that cause discomfort to unauthorized handlers
  - Illusory disguises that make the book appear as something else
  - Explosive runes or sepia snake sigils to harm unauthorized readers
  - Fire trap spells to destroy the book if tampered with
  - Secret page spells to hide sensitive information

- **Practical Protection**:
  - Keeping spell books in locked chests or cabinets
  - Entrusting backup copies to trusted associates
  - Maintaining a low profile about the existence and location of spell books
  - Using codes, ciphers, or personal notation systems that others cannot easily decipher

## Reading Spell Books

The readability of spell books varies by circumstance:

- **Owner Reading**: The owner of a spell book can read and understand it without difficulty, as it was created using their personal notation system.

- **Other Magic-Users Reading**: Other magic-users attempting to read someone else's spell book face several challenges:
  - Personal notation systems make direct reading difficult or impossible
  - A read magic spell is typically required to decipher another's magical writing
  - Even with read magic, comprehension is limited by the reader's Intelligence and level
  - Complete understanding typically requires 1d4 hours of study per spell level

- **Non-Magic-Users Reading**: Non-magic-users cannot meaningfully read spell books, even with read magic, as they lack the fundamental understanding of magical theory necessary for comprehension.

- **Comprehension Chance**: The chance of a magic-user comprehending a spell from another's spell book is based on:
  - The reader's Intelligence
  - The spell's level relative to the highest level the reader can cast
  - Similarity to spells the reader already knows
  - Time spent studying the spell

## Spell Book Damage and Loss

Damage to or loss of spell books can be a significant setback:

- **Physical Damage**: Spell books can be damaged by:
  - Fire, water, or other environmental hazards
  - Combat or adventuring mishaps
  - Improper storage or handling
  - Deliberate vandalism by enemies

- **Magical Damage**: Spell books can be affected by:
  - Dispel magic, which may temporarily render spells unreadable
  - Erase spells, which can remove specific content
  - Various destructive spells that affect paper, ink, or leather
  - Magical aging or decay effects

- **Consequences of Loss**: Losing a spell book has serious consequences:
  - The magic-user cannot prepare any spells not currently memorized
  - Replacing lost spells requires finding new sources or conducting original research
  - The financial and time investment in the book is lost
  - Unique spells or notations may be irretrievably lost

- **Recovery Options**: Magic-users can attempt to recover from spell book loss through:
  - Using backup spell books, if available
  - Copying spells from scrolls or other magic-users' books
  - Researching spells anew, which is time-consuming and expensive
  - Seeking magical means of recovery, such as wish spells

## Spell Books in the Campaign

The DM should consider several factors regarding spell books in the campaign:

- **Availability as Treasure**: Spell books found as treasure should be:
  - Appropriate to the former owner's level and specialty
  - Potentially damaged, incomplete, or trapped
  - Valuable but challenging to use due to personal notation systems
  - Possibly containing unique or rare spells as special rewards

- **Security Concerns**: NPCs with spell books should take appropriate security measures:
  - Powerful magic-users have elaborate protections for their libraries
  - Magical academies have strict protocols for spell book access
  - Spell book theft is a serious crime in magical communities
  - Magical guilds may maintain registries of known spell books

- **Cultural Significance**: Spell books may have cultural significance beyond their practical use:
  - Ancient spell books as historical artifacts
  - Famous spell books known for containing powerful or unique spells
  - Traditional formats or styles specific to different magical traditions
  - Spell books as status symbols among magic-users

- **Plot Hooks**: Spell books can serve as plot hooks in various ways:
  - Quests to recover stolen or lost spell books
  - Searches for legendary spell books containing powerful spells
  - Conflicts over spell books containing controversial or dangerous magic
  - Mysteries surrounding encoded or cryptic spell books

## Conclusion

Spell books are essential tools for arcane spellcasters in the AD&D game, representing both practical necessities and significant investments of time, money, and knowledge. The DM should use spell books thoughtfully to enhance the campaign, considering their value, vulnerability, and significance to magic-user characters. By understanding the nature, creation, and protection of spell books, the DM can create more realistic and engaging magical elements in the campaign world.
