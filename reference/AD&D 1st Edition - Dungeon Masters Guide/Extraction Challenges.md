# Extraction Challenges

This document records items from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide that present challenges for extraction, along with the reasons for these challenges.

## Spell-Specific Content

### Challenge: Detailed Spell Descriptions
- **Items Affected**: Illusionist Spells, Clerical Spells, Druidic Spells, Magic-User Spells
- **Reason**: While the Dungeon Master's Guide contains some information about spells, the detailed spell descriptions are primarily found in the Player's Handbook and other supplementary books.
- **Resolution**: These detailed spell descriptions will be extracted from their respective source books at a later stage. For now, we will focus on extracting the general spell-related guidance and rules from the DMG.

## Monster-Specific Content

### Challenge: Extensive Monster Statistics
- **Items Affected**: Monster Statistics, Monster Abilities, specific monster categories
- **Reason**: The detailed monster statistics and descriptions are primarily found in the Monster Manual, not the Dungeon Master's Guide. The DMG contains guidelines for using monsters, creating new monsters, and special rules for specific monster types.
- **Resolution**: Complete monster statistics and descriptions will be extracted from the Monster Manual at a later stage. For now, we will focus on extracting the monster-related guidance and rules from the DMG.

## Tables and Charts

### Challenge: Complex Formatting
- **Items Affected**: Various tables throughout the guide
- **Reason**: The original Dungeon Master's Guide contains numerous complex tables with specific formatting that is difficult to reproduce accurately in markdown format.
- **Resolution**: We've developed a standardized approach for extracting tables that preserves the essential information while maintaining readability for both humans and AI agents. This includes:
  1. Standard markdown tables for simple tabular data
  2. Structured lists for complex tables with nested information
  3. Numbered list format for very large tables (like random encounter tables)
  4. Consistent labeling and notes to preserve context

  See the "Examples/Table Example.md" file for demonstrations of these approaches.

## Illustrations and Diagrams

### Challenge: Visual Content
- **Items Affected**: Maps, diagrams, and illustrations
- **Reason**: The original Dungeon Master's Guide contains various illustrations, diagrams, and maps that cannot be directly extracted as text.
- **Potential Solution**: Describe the essential information conveyed by illustrations in text form, noting that the original visual elements are not included.

## Appendices and References

### Challenge: Reference Material
- **Items Affected**: Various appendices and reference sections
- **Reason**: Some sections of the Dungeon Master's Guide serve primarily as reference material, with extensive lists, tables, or cross-references that may not translate well to the extraction format.
- **Potential Solution**: Summarize the purpose and content of reference sections, noting that users should consult the original guide for complete reference material.

## Copyright Considerations

### Challenge: Direct Quotation
- **Items Affected**: All extracted content
- **Reason**: Direct, extensive quotation from the original Dungeon Master's Guide could raise copyright concerns.
- **Potential Solution**: Focus on extracting the essential information and concepts rather than direct quotations, and clearly mark all content as being extracted from the original source for educational/reference purposes.

## Extraction Progress Notes

This section will be updated as specific challenges are encountered during the extraction process.

### May 10, 2023
- **Challenge**: Content distributed across multiple rulebooks
- **Items Affected**: Spell descriptions, monster statistics, character class abilities
- **Resolution**: We will focus on extracting content that is primarily in the DMG, while noting that detailed spell descriptions, monster statistics, and some class abilities will be extracted from their respective source books (Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, etc.) at a later stage.
