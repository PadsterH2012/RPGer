# Loyalty of Henchmen & Hirelings, Obedience, and Morale

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, the loyalty, obedience, and morale of henchmen and hirelings are crucial factors that affect their behavior and reliability. This section provides detailed information on these factors and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in the campaign.

## Loyalty

Loyalty represents the dedication and faithfulness of henchmen and hirelings to the character they serve. It affects their willingness to follow orders, take risks, and remain in service.

### Loyalty Base

Each henchman or hireling has a loyalty base determined by several factors:

- **Character's Charisma**: The character's Charisma score provides a base loyalty percentage, as shown in the following table:

| Charisma | Loyalty Base |
|----------|--------------|
| 3        | 30%          |
| 4        | 35%          |
| 5        | 40%          |
| 6        | 45%          |
| 7        | 50%          |
| 8        | 55%          |
| 9-12     | 60%          |
| 13       | 65%          |
| 14       | 70%          |
| 15       | 75%          |
| 16       | 80%          |
| 17       | 85%          |
| 18       | 90%          |

- **Alignment Compatibility**: Henchmen and hirelings with alignments compatible with the character's alignment receive a loyalty bonus, while those with incompatible alignments suffer a loyalty penalty.
- **Treatment**: The treatment of henchmen and hirelings by the character affects their loyalty. Fair treatment, respect, appropriate rewards, and consideration for their well-being can improve loyalty, while poor treatment, disrespect, inadequate rewards, or disregard for their safety can decrease it.
- **Length of Service**: Henchmen and hirelings who have served the character for a long time typically have higher loyalty than those who have recently entered service.
- **Shared Experiences**: Henchmen and hirelings who have shared significant experiences with the character, particularly successful adventures or overcoming challenges together, typically have higher loyalty.

### Loyalty Checks

Loyalty checks are made in certain situations to determine whether a henchman or hireling remains loyal or takes other actions. The following guidelines apply:

- **When to Check**: Loyalty checks are typically made in situations where the henchman or hireling's loyalty might be tested, such as when faced with extreme danger, when offered bribes or other inducements to betray their master, or when given orders that conflict with their personal values or interests.
- **How to Check**: To make a loyalty check, the DM rolls percentile dice. If the roll is equal to or less than the henchman or hireling's loyalty percentage, they remain loyal. If the roll is greater than their loyalty percentage, they may act against their master's interests or leave service.
- **Modifiers**: Various factors can modify the loyalty check, such as the specific nature of the situation, the character's recent treatment of the henchman or hireling, and any special bonds or conflicts between them.

### Improving Loyalty

Characters can take various actions to improve the loyalty of their henchmen and hirelings:

- **Fair Treatment**: Treating henchmen and hirelings fairly, with respect and consideration for their well-being, can improve loyalty.
- **Appropriate Rewards**: Providing appropriate rewards, including fair shares of treasure, suitable equipment, and recognition for achievements, can improve loyalty.
- **Personal Interest**: Showing personal interest in henchmen and hirelings, including learning about their backgrounds, goals, and concerns, can improve loyalty.
- **Shared Risks**: Sharing risks with henchmen and hirelings, rather than sending them into danger while staying safe, can improve loyalty.
- **Consistent Leadership**: Providing consistent, fair, and effective leadership can improve loyalty.

## Obedience

Obedience represents the willingness of henchmen and hirelings to follow orders and comply with the character's wishes. It is related to but distinct from loyalty, as a henchman or hireling might be loyal but still question or resist certain orders.

### Factors Affecting Obedience

Several factors affect the obedience of henchmen and hirelings:

- **Loyalty**: Higher loyalty generally leads to greater obedience, as henchmen and hirelings who are deeply loyal to a character are more likely to follow their orders.
- **Order Reasonableness**: The reasonableness of the order affects obedience. Orders that are clearly reasonable and in the best interests of the group are more likely to be obeyed than orders that are unreasonable, dangerous, or contrary to the henchman or hireling's values.
- **Character's Leadership**: The character's leadership ability, as demonstrated through their actions and decisions, affects obedience. Henchmen and hirelings are more likely to obey characters who have shown good judgment and effective leadership in the past.
- **Consequences**: The perceived consequences of disobedience affect obedience. If henchmen or hirelings believe that disobedience will lead to severe punishment or other negative consequences, they may obey even if they disagree with the order.

### Obedience Checks

In situations where a henchman or hireling's obedience might be questioned, the DM may call for an obedience check. The following guidelines apply:

- **When to Check**: Obedience checks are typically made when a character gives an order that is dangerous, contrary to the henchman or hireling's interests or values, or otherwise questionable.
- **How to Check**: To make an obedience check, the DM rolls percentile dice and compares the result to the henchman or hireling's loyalty percentage, modified by the factors affecting obedience. If the roll is equal to or less than the modified loyalty percentage, the henchman or hireling obeys. If the roll is greater than the modified loyalty percentage, they may question, delay, or refuse the order.
- **Modifiers**: Various factors can modify the obedience check, such as the specific nature of the order, the character's recent treatment of the henchman or hireling, and any special circumstances that might affect obedience.

## Morale

Morale represents the confidence, courage, and determination of henchmen and hirelings, particularly in combat and other stressful situations. It affects their effectiveness and their willingness to continue in the face of danger or difficulty.

### Morale Base

Each henchman or hireling has a morale base determined by several factors:

- **Character's Charisma**: The character's Charisma score provides a base morale modifier, as shown in the following table:

| Charisma | Morale Modifier |
|----------|----------------|
| 3        | -3             |
| 4-5      | -2             |
| 6-8      | -1             |
| 9-12     | 0              |
| 13-15    | +1             |
| 16-17    | +2             |
| 18       | +3             |

- **Loyalty**: Higher loyalty generally leads to higher morale, as henchmen and hirelings who are deeply loyal to a character are more likely to maintain their courage and determination.
- **Experience**: More experienced henchmen and hirelings, particularly those who have faced danger and overcome challenges, typically have higher morale than inexperienced ones.
- **Recent Events**: Recent successes can improve morale, while recent failures or losses can decrease it.
- **Physical Condition**: Henchmen and hirelings who are well-rested, well-fed, and in good health typically have higher morale than those who are tired, hungry, or injured.

### Morale Checks

Morale checks are made in certain situations to determine whether henchmen and hirelings maintain their courage and determination or falter. The following guidelines apply:

- **When to Check**: Morale checks are typically made in situations where henchmen and hirelings might lose heart, such as when facing overwhelming odds, when suffering significant casualties, or when confronted with terrifying creatures or phenomena.
- **How to Check**: To make a morale check, the DM rolls 2d10 and compares the result to the henchman or hireling's morale score (typically 50 plus or minus modifiers). If the roll is equal to or less than the morale score, they maintain their morale. If the roll is greater than the morale score, they may falter, flee, or surrender.
- **Modifiers**: Various factors can modify the morale check, such as the specific nature of the situation, the character's leadership, and any special circumstances that might affect morale.

### Improving Morale

Characters can take various actions to improve the morale of their henchmen and hirelings:

- **Leadership by Example**: Demonstrating courage and determination can improve morale.
- **Success**: Achieving successes, particularly in combat or other challenging situations, can improve morale.
- **Rewards**: Providing appropriate rewards for courage and achievement can improve morale.
- **Care**: Ensuring that henchmen and hirelings are well-rested, well-fed, and properly equipped can improve morale.
- **Inspiration**: Providing inspiration through speeches, symbols, or other means can improve morale.

## Conclusion

The loyalty, obedience, and morale of henchmen and hirelings are crucial factors that affect their behavior and reliability in the AD&D game. The DM should use these factors to create realistic and engaging NPCs who respond to the characters' leadership and treatment in believable ways, adding depth and challenge to the campaign.
