# Henchmen

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, henchmen are non-player characters (NPCs) who serve as loyal followers of player characters. Unlike hirelings, who are employees who perform specific services for payment, henchmen are followers who accompany the character on adventures and share in the risks and rewards. This section provides an overview of henchmen and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in the campaign.

## Nature of Henchmen

Henchmen are characterized by the following traits:

- **Loyalty**: Henchmen are loyal to the character they serve, following their leadership and supporting their goals. This loyalty is based on respect, shared values, or other bonds, rather than merely financial compensation.
- **Adventuring Companions**: Henchmen accompany the character on adventures, facing dangers and challenges alongside them. They are not merely servants or employees but partners in the character's quests.
- **Shared Rewards**: Henchmen receive a share of treasure and experience points from adventures, allowing them to advance in level and acquire equipment. The specific share is typically negotiated when the henchman joins the character.
- **Independent Entities**: Henchmen are independent NPCs with their own personalities, goals, and values. While they are loyal to the character they serve, they are not mindless servants and may have their own opinions and preferences.

## Acquiring Henchmen

Characters can acquire henchmen in various ways:

- **Recruitment**: Characters can actively recruit potential henchmen by seeking out individuals with appropriate skills and offering them the opportunity to join as followers.
- **Attraction**: Characters of high level or reputation may attract potential henchmen who seek to learn from them or share in their adventures.
- **Conversion**: NPCs who have positive interactions with a character, such as being rescued or aided in a significant way, may choose to become henchmen out of gratitude or admiration.
- **Inheritance**: In some cases, a character may inherit henchmen from another character, such as a mentor who retires or dies.

## Limitations on Henchmen

There are several limitations on the number and nature of henchmen a character can have:

- **Charisma Limit**: The maximum number of henchmen a character can have is determined by their Charisma score. A character with average Charisma (9-12) can have 4 henchmen, while a character with exceptional Charisma (18) can have 10 henchmen.
- **Level Limit**: Henchmen are typically of lower level than the character they serve. The specific level difference may vary, but henchmen are generally at least one level lower than their master.
- **Alignment Compatibility**: Henchmen typically have alignments compatible with the character they serve. While exact alignment matches are not required, significant alignment conflicts are rare and may lead to problems.
- **Class Compatibility**: Some character classes may have restrictions on the types of henchmen they can have. For example, paladins may only have lawful good henchmen, while druids may prefer henchmen with nature-oriented classes.

## Henchmen Characteristics

Henchmen have various characteristics that define their abilities and role:

- **Class and Level**: Henchmen have a specific character class and level, with associated abilities and limitations. They advance in level by earning experience points, just like player characters.
- **Ability Scores**: Henchmen have ability scores (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma) that determine their capabilities. These scores are typically generated using the same methods as for player characters.
- **Equipment**: Henchmen have their own equipment, which may be provided by the character they serve or acquired through their share of treasure. The quality and quantity of equipment typically reflect the henchman's level and the generosity of their master.
- **Personality**: Henchmen have distinct personalities, with their own goals, fears, and quirks. These personalities should be role-played by the DM to create interesting interactions and relationships.

## Loyalty and Morale

The loyalty and morale of henchmen are crucial factors that affect their behavior and reliability:

- **Loyalty Base**: Each henchman has a loyalty base determined by the character's Charisma and other factors. This loyalty can be increased by good treatment and decreased by poor treatment.
- **Loyalty Checks**: Henchmen may be required to make loyalty checks in certain situations, such as when faced with extreme danger or when offered bribes or other inducements to betray their master. The result of these checks determines whether the henchman remains loyal or takes other actions.
- **Morale**: Henchmen have morale that affects their behavior in combat and other stressful situations. High morale leads to brave and effective performance, while low morale may result in hesitation, ineffectiveness, or even flight.
- **Treatment**: The treatment of henchmen by their master significantly affects their loyalty and morale. Fair treatment, respect, appropriate shares of treasure, and consideration for their well-being can improve loyalty and morale, while poor treatment, disrespect, inadequate shares, or disregard for their safety can decrease them.

## Managing Henchmen

The DM should consider the following factors when managing henchmen in the campaign:

- **Role-Playing**: Henchmen should be role-played as distinct NPCs with their own personalities, goals, and perspectives. This adds depth to the game and provides opportunities for interesting interactions.
- **Development**: Henchmen should develop over time, both in terms of their abilities (as they gain experience and advance in level) and in terms of their personalities and relationships. Long-term henchmen may become close friends or even family to the characters they serve.
- **Agency**: Henchmen should have a degree of agency, making their own decisions and taking their own actions when appropriate. While they generally follow the leadership of their master, they are not mindless automatons.
- **Relationships**: The relationships between henchmen and the characters they serve, as well as between different henchmen, can be a rich source of role-playing opportunities and plot developments.

## Henchmen in Combat

Henchmen typically participate in combat alongside the characters they serve:

- **Control**: Henchmen are controlled by the DM during combat, though they generally follow the tactical directions of their master unless these would be suicidal or otherwise unreasonable.
- **Effectiveness**: The effectiveness of henchmen in combat depends on their class, level, ability scores, equipment, and morale. Higher-level henchmen with good equipment and high morale can be significant assets in combat.
- **Casualties**: If a henchman is injured or killed in combat, there may be emotional, practical, and possibly legal or social consequences. The death of a long-term henchman can be a significant event in a campaign, affecting the character emotionally and potentially influencing their future actions.

## Rewards for Henchmen

Henchmen receive various rewards for their service:

- **Experience Points**: Henchmen receive a share of the experience points earned during adventures, typically half the amount that would be awarded to a player character of the same class and level. This allows them to advance in level over time.
- **Treasure**: Henchmen receive a share of treasure found during adventures. The specific share is typically negotiated when the henchman joins the character, but it is often around 10-15% of the character's share.
- **Equipment**: Characters typically provide their henchmen with appropriate equipment, or allow them to purchase equipment with their share of treasure. Well-equipped henchmen are more effective and more likely to survive.
- **Training**: Characters may provide training for their henchmen, helping them to improve their skills and advance in level. This can be a significant benefit, particularly for henchmen who serve magic-users, clerics, or other classes that require specialized training.

## Conclusion

Henchmen add depth and complexity to the AD&D game, providing characters with loyal followers who share in their adventures and creating opportunities for role-playing and campaign development. The DM should use henchmen as a tool to enhance the game experience, creating interesting NPCs with distinct personalities and abilities who can contribute to the campaign in meaningful ways.
