# Magic-User Spells

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Magic-user spells in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game represent arcane magic learned through study and practice. This section provides detailed information on magic-user spells and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in the campaign.

## Nature of Magic-User Spells

Magic-user spells have the following characteristics:

- **Arcane Source**: Magic-user spells draw on arcane energies and are learned through study and practice, rather than being granted by deities or natural forces.
- **Spell Books**: Magic-users record their spells in spell books, which they must study to memorize spells before casting them.
- **Complexity**: Magic-user spells often involve complex formulas, gestures, and incantations, reflecting the intellectual and academic nature of arcane magic.
- **Versatility**: Magic-user spells cover a wide range of effects, from direct damage to utility to powerful alterations of reality, making magic-users versatile but specialized spellcasters.
- **Components**: Magic-user spells typically require verbal, somatic, and material components. The verbal components are often arcane words of power, the somatic components are precise gestures, and the material components can range from common items to rare and expensive substances.

## Learning Magic-User Spells

Magic-users learn spells through the following process:

- **Starting Spells**: A beginning magic-user starts with a spell book containing read magic and 1-4 other first-level spells, determined by the DM or chosen by the player with the DM's approval.
- **Learning from Scrolls or Books**: Magic-users can attempt to learn spells from scrolls or other magic-users' spell books. The chance of successfully learning a spell depends on the magic-user's Intelligence and the level of the spell.
- **Research**: Magic-users can research new spells or variations of existing spells. This typically takes time and resources, and success is not guaranteed.
- **Intelligence Limits**: A magic-user's Intelligence determines the maximum level of spells they can learn and the maximum number of spells of each level they can know, as shown in the following table:

| Intelligence | Max Spell Level | Min/Max Spells per Level |
|--------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 9            | 4th            | 35% / 6                  |
| 10           | 5th            | 40% / 7                  |
| 11           | 5th            | 45% / 7                  |
| 12           | 6th            | 50% / 7                  |
| 13           | 6th            | 55% / 9                  |
| 14           | 7th            | 60% / 9                  |
| 15           | 7th            | 65% / 11                 |
| 16           | 8th            | 70% / 11                 |
| 17           | 8th            | 75% / 14                 |
| 18           | 9th            | 85% / 18                 |

## Memorizing and Casting Magic-User Spells

Magic-users memorize and cast spells through the following process:

- **Study**: Magic-users must study their spell books to memorize spells. This typically takes 15 minutes per spell level (e.g., 15 minutes for a 1st-level spell, 30 minutes for a 2nd-level spell, etc.).
- **Memorization Limits**: Magic-users can memorize a limited number of spells of each level, based on their magic-user level. These limits are specified in the Players Handbook.
- **Casting**: When a magic-user casts a memorized spell, the spell is erased from their mind and must be re-memorized before it can be cast again.
- **Components**: Magic-user spells typically require verbal, somatic, and material components. If a magic-user cannot speak, move their hands, or access the required material components, they cannot cast spells that require those components.
- **Casting Time**: Each spell has a casting time, representing how long it takes to cast the spell. This can range from a segment (1/10 of a round) to several rounds or even longer for complex spells.

## Spell Books

Spell books are crucial to magic-users. The following guidelines apply:

- **Standard Spell Books**: A standard spell book contains about 100 pages and can hold approximately 100 spell levels (e.g., 100 1st-level spells, 50 2nd-level spells, etc.).
- **Traveling Spell Books**: Many magic-users maintain smaller, more portable spell books for traveling, containing a subset of their spells.
- **Protection**: Spell books are valuable and vulnerable. Many magic-users protect their spell books with locks, traps, or magical wards.
- **Copying Spells**: Copying a spell from one book to another typically takes 1 day per spell level and costs 100 gold pieces per spell level for materials.
- **Loss or Damage**: If a magic-user's spell book is lost or damaged, they can still cast any spells they have memorized, but they cannot memorize new spells from that book until it is recovered or replaced.

## Spell Research

Magic-users can research new spells or variations of existing spells. The following guidelines apply:

- **Research Time**: Researching a new spell typically takes 1-2 weeks per spell level, plus time for testing and refinement.
- **Research Cost**: Researching a new spell typically costs 200-1,000 gold pieces per spell level, covering materials, components, and possibly consultation with other magic-users.
- **Success Chance**: The chance of successfully researching a new spell depends on the magic-user's Intelligence, the spell level, and the complexity of the desired effect.
- **Limitations**: New spells should be balanced and consistent with the existing spell system. The DM has final authority on what spells can be researched and how they function.

## Adjudicating Magic-User Spells

The DM should consider the following factors when adjudicating magic-user spells:

- **Spell Descriptions**: The descriptions of spells in the Players Handbook and other sources provide the basic parameters of how spells function. The DM should use these as a starting point.
- **Intelligence Factor**: The magic-user's Intelligence should be considered when determining the effectiveness of their spells, particularly for spells that involve mental manipulation or the creation of complex effects.
- **Environmental Factors**: The environment in which a spell is cast may affect its functioning. For example, a fireball cast in a small, enclosed space might have different effects than one cast in an open field.
- **Countermeasures**: Various countermeasures, such as dispel magic or anti-magic shell, can negate or alter the effects of magic-user spells. The DM should determine the outcome of such interactions based on the specific spells involved and their relative power levels.

## Specific Magic-User Spell Categories

Certain categories of magic-user spells raise specific adjudication issues:

- **Illusion Spells**: Spells like phantasmal force and improved invisibility raise questions about how creatures interact with the illusions. The DM should determine these interactions based on the spell description, the intelligence and senses of the creatures, and logical considerations.
- **Enchantment Spells**: Spells like charm person and suggestion raise questions about what actions affected creatures will take. The DM should determine these actions based on the spell description, the creature's personality and goals, and logical considerations.
- **Conjuration Spells**: Spells like monster summoning and conjure elemental raise questions about the behavior and capabilities of the conjured creatures. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the nature of the conjured creatures.
- **Alteration Spells**: Spells like polymorph self and teleport raise questions about the extent and limitations of the alterations. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and logical considerations.

## Magic-User Specializations

In some campaign settings, magic-users may specialize in certain schools of magic. The following guidelines apply:

- **Specialist Advantages**: Specialists receive advantages when casting spells from their chosen school, such as increased range, duration, or effect, or reduced casting time or component requirements.
- **Specialist Disadvantages**: Specialists may have disadvantages when casting spells from opposing schools, such as decreased range, duration, or effect, or increased casting time or component requirements.
- **School Restrictions**: Some spells may be restricted to specialists of certain schools, while others may be available to all magic-users.

## Conclusion

Magic-user spells add an arcane dimension to the AD&D game, providing magic-users with a wide range of abilities that reflect their role as students and practitioners of arcane magic. The DM should use these guidelines to handle magic-user spells in a way that is balanced, consistent, and enhances the game experience for all players.
