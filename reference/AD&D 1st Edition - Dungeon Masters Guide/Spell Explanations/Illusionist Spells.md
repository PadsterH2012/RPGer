# Illusionist Spells

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Illusionist spells in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game represent a specialized form of arcane magic focused on illusion, deception, and manipulation of perceptions. This section provides detailed information on illusionist spells and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in the campaign.

## Nature of Illusionist Spells

Illusionist spells have the following characteristics:

- **Specialized Arcane Magic**: Like magic-user spells, illusionist spells are arcane in nature and are learned through study and practice. However, they focus specifically on illusion and related effects.
- **Perception Manipulation**: Many illusionist spells manipulate how creatures perceive reality, creating false sensory impressions or altering existing ones.
- **Mental Influence**: Some illusionist spells directly influence the minds of targets, affecting their thoughts, emotions, or behaviors.
- **Subtlety**: Illusionist spells often rely on subtlety and misdirection rather than brute force, making them particularly effective when used creatively.
- **Components**: Like magic-user spells, illusionist spells typically require verbal, somatic, and material components. The material components often include items that reflect or distort light, such as crystal, mica, or sand.

## Learning Illusionist Spells

Illusionists learn spells through the following process:

- **Starting Spells**: A beginning illusionist starts with a spell book containing read magic and 1-4 other first-level illusionist spells, determined by the DM or chosen by the player with the DM's approval.
- **Learning from Scrolls or Books**: Illusionists can attempt to learn spells from scrolls or other illusionists' spell books. The chance of successfully learning a spell depends on the illusionist's Intelligence and the level of the spell.
- **Research**: Illusionists can research new spells or variations of existing spells. This typically takes time and resources, and success is not guaranteed.
- **Intelligence Requirements**: Illusionists must have a minimum Intelligence of 15 and a minimum Dexterity of 16. Their Intelligence determines the maximum level of spells they can learn and the maximum number of spells of each level they can know, similar to magic-users.

## Memorizing and Casting Illusionist Spells

Illusionists memorize and cast spells through the following process:

- **Study**: Illusionists must study their spell books to memorize spells. This typically takes 15 minutes per spell level (e.g., 15 minutes for a 1st-level spell, 30 minutes for a 2nd-level spell, etc.).
- **Memorization Limits**: Illusionists can memorize a limited number of spells of each level, based on their illusionist level. These limits are specified in the Players Handbook.
- **Casting**: When an illusionist casts a memorized spell, the spell is erased from their mind and must be re-memorized before it can be cast again.
- **Components**: Illusionist spells typically require verbal, somatic, and material components. If an illusionist cannot speak, move their hands, or access the required material components, they cannot cast spells that require those components.
- **Casting Time**: Each spell has a casting time, representing how long it takes to cast the spell. This can range from a segment (1/10 of a round) to several rounds or even longer for complex spells.

## Spell Books

Like magic-users, illusionists record their spells in spell books. The following guidelines apply:

- **Standard Spell Books**: A standard spell book contains about 100 pages and can hold approximately 100 spell levels (e.g., 100 1st-level spells, 50 2nd-level spells, etc.).
- **Traveling Spell Books**: Many illusionists maintain smaller, more portable spell books for traveling, containing a subset of their spells.
- **Protection**: Spell books are valuable and vulnerable. Many illusionists protect their spell books with locks, traps, or magical wards, which may include illusory protections.
- **Copying Spells**: Copying a spell from one book to another typically takes 1 day per spell level and costs 100 gold pieces per spell level for materials.
- **Loss or Damage**: If an illusionist's spell book is lost or damaged, they can still cast any spells they have memorized, but they cannot memorize new spells from that book until it is recovered or replaced.

## Illusion Mechanics

The mechanics of illusion spells raise specific adjudication issues:

- **Saving Throws**: Most illusion spells allow a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion. If the saving throw succeeds, the target recognizes the illusion for what it is and is not affected by it.
- **Interaction**: Physical interaction with an illusion typically reveals it to be false. For example, touching an illusory wall would reveal that there is nothing there.
- **Consistency**: Illusions should be consistent with the environment and the expectations of the targets. Inconsistent or implausible illusions may grant bonuses to saving throws to disbelieve.
- **Sensory Components**: Different illusion spells affect different senses. Some create visual illusions only, while others may include auditory, olfactory, or even tactile components.
- **Semi-Real Illusions**: Some high-level illusion spells, such as shadow monsters or demi-shadow magic, create partially real effects that can cause actual harm even to creatures that disbelieve them.

## Adjudicating Illusionist Spells

The DM should consider the following factors when adjudicating illusionist spells:

- **Intelligence Factor**: The intelligence of targets should be considered when determining their ability to disbelieve illusions. More intelligent creatures may be more likely to notice inconsistencies or implausibilities in illusions.
- **Sensory Limitations**: Creatures with limited or different senses may interact with illusions differently. For example, a blind creature would be immune to purely visual illusions but might be affected by auditory illusions.
- **Environmental Factors**: The environment in which an illusion is cast may affect its believability. For example, an illusion of a water elemental might be more believable near a body of water than in a desert.
- **Creative Use**: The DM should encourage creative use of illusion spells while ensuring that such uses remain balanced and consistent with the spell's description and level.

## Specific Illusionist Spell Categories

Certain categories of illusionist spells raise specific adjudication issues:

- **Phantasms**: Spells like phantasmal force and improved phantasmal force create illusions that exist only in the minds of the targets. These raise questions about what happens when multiple creatures perceive the same phantasm differently.
- **Glamers**: Spells like change self and invisibility alter the appearance of real objects or creatures. These raise questions about how the altered appearance interacts with the environment and other creatures.
- **Shadow Spells**: Spells like shadow monsters and demi-shadow magic create partially real effects from shadow material. These raise questions about how real the effects are and how they interact with the physical world.
- **Pattern Spells**: Spells like hypnotic pattern and rainbow pattern create visual patterns that affect the minds of those who see them. These raise questions about what creatures can be affected and how they behave while affected.

## Illusionist vs. Magic-User Spells

Some spells appear on both the illusionist and magic-user spell lists, but they may function differently for each class:

- **Spell Level**: A spell may be of different levels for illusionists and magic-users, reflecting the relative difficulty for each class to master that type of magic.
- **Spell Effects**: The effects of a spell may vary slightly between the illusionist and magic-user versions, reflecting the different approaches to magic.
- **Spell Components**: The components required for a spell may differ between the illusionist and magic-user versions, reflecting the different magical traditions.

## Conclusion

Illusionist spells add a dimension of deception and perception manipulation to the AD&D game, providing illusionists with a unique set of abilities that reward creativity and clever thinking. The DM should use these guidelines to handle illusionist spells in a way that is balanced, consistent, and enhances the game experience for all players.
