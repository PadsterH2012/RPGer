# Spell Explanations

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Magic is a fundamental element of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, and spells are the primary means by which magic is manifested. This section provides an overview of spells and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in the campaign.

## Nature of Spells

Spells in the AD&D game are specific formulae for harnessing magical energies to produce specific effects. The following characteristics apply to spells:

- **Memorization**: Spellcasters must memorize spells before they can be cast. This process involves studying spell books (for magic-users and illusionists) or praying for divine favor (for clerics and druids).
- **Casting**: Casting a spell involves specific verbal, somatic, and material components. The caster must be able to speak, move their hands, and have access to any required material components.
- **Spell Levels**: Spells are organized into levels, from 1st to 9th, with higher-level spells being more powerful and requiring more experienced spellcasters to use.
- **Spell Slots**: Spellcasters have a limited number of spell slots for each spell level, representing the number of spells of that level they can memorize and cast per day.
- **Casting Time**: Each spell has a casting time, representing how long it takes to cast the spell. This can range from a segment (1/10 of a round) to hours or even days for the most complex spells.
- **Range**: Each spell has a range, representing the maximum distance at which the spell can affect targets. This can range from touch to hundreds of yards or more.
- **Duration**: Each spell has a duration, representing how long its effects last. This can range from instantaneous to permanent, with many spells lasting for a specific number of rounds, turns, or hours.
- **Area of Effect**: Each spell has an area of effect, representing the space or targets it can affect. This can range from a single creature or object to a large area.
- **Saving Throw**: Many spells allow targets to make a saving throw to resist or reduce the spell's effects. The specific type of saving throw and the consequences of success or failure vary by spell.

## Types of Spells

There are several types of spells in the AD&D game, each with its own characteristics and rules:

- **Arcane Spells**: Cast by magic-users and illusionists, these spells draw on arcane knowledge and manipulation of magical energies. They require spell books, study, and precise components.
- **Divine Spells**: Cast by clerics and druids, these spells draw on divine power granted by deities or natural forces. They require prayer and devotion rather than study.
- **Reversible Spells**: Some spells can be cast in reverse, producing an opposite effect. For example, cure light wounds can be reversed to cause light wounds.
- **Ritual Spells**: Some spells require elaborate rituals to cast, involving multiple participants, rare components, or specific conditions. These are typically more powerful than standard spells.
- **Permanent Spells**: Some spells create permanent effects, which remain until dispelled or destroyed. These often require significant resources or experience to cast.

## Spell Components

Most spells require specific components to cast:

- **Verbal Components (V)**: Specific words or phrases that must be spoken aloud. A spellcaster who cannot speak (due to silence, gagging, etc.) cannot cast spells with verbal components.
- **Somatic Components (S)**: Specific gestures or movements that must be performed. A spellcaster who cannot move their hands (due to binding, paralysis, etc.) cannot cast spells with somatic components.
- **Material Components (M)**: Specific physical items that are consumed or used during casting. A spellcaster who does not have the required material components cannot cast spells that require them.

## Spell Research

Spellcasters can research new spells or variations of existing spells. The following guidelines apply:

- **Research Time**: Researching a new spell typically takes 1-2 weeks per spell level, plus time for testing and refinement.
- **Research Cost**: Researching a new spell typically costs 200-1,000 gold pieces per spell level, covering materials, components, and possibly consultation with other spellcasters.
- **Success Chance**: The chance of successfully researching a new spell depends on the spellcaster's Intelligence (for arcane spellcasters) or Wisdom (for divine spellcasters), the spell level, and the complexity of the desired effect.
- **Limitations**: New spells should be balanced and consistent with the existing spell system. The DM has final authority on what spells can be researched and how they function.

## Spell Books

Magic-users and illusionists record their spells in spell books. The following guidelines apply:

- **Standard Spell Books**: A standard spell book contains about 100 pages and can hold approximately 100 spell levels (e.g., 100 1st-level spells, 50 2nd-level spells, etc.).
- **Traveling Spell Books**: Many magic-users and illusionists maintain smaller, more portable spell books for traveling, containing a subset of their spells.
- **Protection**: Spell books are valuable and vulnerable. Many magic-users and illusionists protect their spell books with locks, traps, or magical wards.
- **Copying Spells**: Copying a spell from one book to another typically takes 1 day per spell level and costs 100 gold pieces per spell level for materials.
- **Learning Spells**: Magic-users and illusionists can attempt to learn spells from other spell books or scrolls. The chance of success depends on the spellcaster's Intelligence and the spell level.

## Spell Scrolls

Spells can be inscribed on scrolls, allowing them to be cast without memorization. The following guidelines apply:

- **Creation**: Creating a spell scroll typically takes 1 day per spell level and costs 100 gold pieces per spell level for materials.
- **Usage**: Using a spell scroll requires reading the scroll aloud, which takes the same amount of time as casting the spell normally. The scroll is consumed in the process.
- **Limitations**: Spell scrolls can only be used by spellcasters of the appropriate class who are capable of casting spells of the scroll's level. Some scrolls may have additional restrictions.
- **Protection Scrolls**: Some scrolls provide protection against specific creatures or effects. These can often be used by any character who can read the scroll.

## Adjudicating Spells

The DM has the responsibility of adjudicating how spells function in specific situations. The following guidelines apply:

- **Spell Descriptions**: The descriptions of spells in the Players Handbook and other sources provide the basic parameters of how spells function. The DM should use these as a starting point.
- **Specific Situations**: When a spell is used in a specific situation not explicitly covered by the spell description, the DM should make a ruling based on the general principles of the spell and the specific circumstances.
- **Creativity**: The DM should encourage creative use of spells while ensuring that such uses remain balanced and consistent with the spell's description and level.
- **Consistency**: The DM should strive for consistency in spell adjudication, establishing precedents that can be applied to similar situations in the future.

## Conclusion

Spells are a complex and powerful aspect of the AD&D game, providing spellcasting characters with a wide range of abilities and options. The DM should use these guidelines to handle spells in a way that is balanced, consistent, and enhances the game experience for all players.
