# Spells: Special Commentary for Refereeing

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

The adjudication of spells is one of the most challenging aspects of the Dungeon Master's (DM's) role in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. This section provides special commentary and guidance for the DM on refereeing spells and handling various spell-related situations that may arise during play.

## General Principles

When adjudicating spells, the DM should keep the following general principles in mind:

- **Balance**: Spells should be powerful and useful, but not game-breaking. The DM should ensure that spells remain balanced relative to their level and to non-magical abilities.
- **Consistency**: The DM should strive for consistency in spell adjudication, establishing precedents that can be applied to similar situations in the future.
- **Specificity**: Specific spell descriptions take precedence over general rules. If a spell description specifies how a particular situation is handled, that specification should be followed.
- **Reasonableness**: The DM should apply common sense and reasonableness when adjudicating spells, considering what would be logical and fair within the context of the game world.
- **Player Creativity**: The DM should encourage creative use of spells while ensuring that such uses remain balanced and consistent with the spell's description and level.

## Spell Components

The verbal, somatic, and material components of spells are important aspects of spell casting that the DM should enforce:

- **Verbal Components**: A spellcaster who cannot speak (due to silence, gagging, etc.) cannot cast spells with verbal components. The DM should consider whether a spellcaster can speak loudly enough to be heard over ambient noise, such as the roar of a waterfall or the din of battle.
- **Somatic Components**: A spellcaster who cannot move their hands (due to binding, paralysis, etc.) cannot cast spells with somatic components. The DM should consider whether a spellcaster has enough freedom of movement to perform the necessary gestures, which can be quite complex.
- **Material Components**: A spellcaster who does not have the required material components cannot cast spells that require them. The DM should track whether spellcasters have the necessary components, particularly for rare or expensive components.

## Spell Interruption

Spells can be interrupted during casting, preventing them from taking effect:

- **Damage**: If a spellcaster takes damage during the casting of a spell, the spell is disrupted and lost. The DM should track initiative and the timing of attacks to determine whether damage occurs before the spell is completed.
- **Distraction**: Significant distractions, such as being grappled or having to dodge a falling boulder, can disrupt spellcasting. The DM should determine whether a distraction is significant enough to disrupt a spell.
- **Counterspells**: Certain spells, such as dispel magic, can be used to counter other spells as they are being cast. The DM should determine the timing and effects of counterspells based on the specific spells involved.

## Spell Targeting

The targeting of spells can raise various adjudication issues:

- **Line of Sight**: Many spells require the caster to see the target. The DM should determine whether the caster has a clear line of sight, considering obstacles, lighting conditions, and other factors.
- **Line of Effect**: Some spells require a clear path from the caster to the target, not just visual contact. The DM should determine whether there is a clear path, considering physical barriers and magical effects.
- **Area of Effect**: Spells with areas of effect, such as fireballs or lightning bolts, can raise questions about which creatures or objects are affected. The DM should determine the precise area affected, considering the spell description and the physical environment.
- **Multiple Targets**: Some spells can affect multiple targets, raising questions about how targets are selected or how effects are distributed. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the specific situation.

## Spell Duration

The duration of spells can raise various adjudication issues:

- **Concentration**: Some spells require concentration to maintain. The DM should determine what activities disrupt concentration, such as taking damage, casting another spell, or engaging in strenuous physical activity.
- **Dismissal**: Some spells can be dismissed by the caster before their duration expires. The DM should determine whether dismissal requires an action and whether it can be done under all circumstances.
- **Overlapping Durations**: When multiple spells with durations affect the same target, questions can arise about how the effects interact. The DM should determine these interactions based on the specific spells involved and logical considerations.
- **Time Measurement**: The measurement of time (rounds, turns, hours, etc.) can become important for spell durations. The DM should track time consistently and determine how spell durations are affected by activities that take varying amounts of time.

## Spell Interactions

The interaction of different spells can raise complex adjudication issues:

- **Stacking**: Whether the effects of multiple spells stack (combine) or not can be a significant question. The DM should determine whether effects stack based on the specific spells involved and logical considerations.
- **Cancellation**: Some spells can cancel or negate others. The DM should determine the outcome of such interactions based on the specific spells involved and their relative power levels.
- **Sequencing**: The order in which spells are cast can affect their interaction. The DM should track the sequence of spellcasting and determine interactions accordingly.
- **Combination Effects**: Sometimes spells can combine to create effects not explicitly covered by either spell. The DM should determine such combination effects based on the specific spells involved and logical considerations.

## Specific Spell Categories

Certain categories of spells raise specific adjudication issues:

- **Divination Spells**: Spells that provide information, such as detect magic or clairvoyance, raise questions about what information is revealed and how it is presented. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the specific situation.
- **Illusion Spells**: Spells that create illusions, such as phantasmal force or improved invisibility, raise questions about how creatures interact with the illusions. The DM should determine these interactions based on the spell description, the intelligence and senses of the creatures, and logical considerations.
- **Enchantment Spells**: Spells that affect minds, such as charm person or suggestion, raise questions about what actions affected creatures will take. The DM should determine these actions based on the spell description, the creature's personality and goals, and logical considerations.
- **Summoning Spells**: Spells that summon creatures, such as monster summoning or conjure elemental, raise questions about the behavior and capabilities of the summoned creatures. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the nature of the summoned creatures.

## Conclusion

The adjudication of spells is a complex but rewarding aspect of the DM's role in the AD&D game. By applying the principles and guidelines provided in this section, the DM can handle spells in a way that is balanced, consistent, and enhances the game experience for all players. Remember that the DM's judgment is the final authority on how spells function in their campaign.
