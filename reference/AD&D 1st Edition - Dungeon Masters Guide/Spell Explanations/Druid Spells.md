# Druid Spells

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Druid spells in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are divine magic granted to druids by nature itself. This section provides detailed information on druid spells and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in the campaign.

## Nature of Druid Spells

Druid spells have the following characteristics:

- **Natural Source**: Druid spells draw power from nature and the natural world, rather than from specific deities like cleric spells. The druid attunes themselves to the natural forces around them and channels this power.
- **Elemental and Animal Themes**: Many druid spells involve control or communion with elements (earth, air, fire, water) or animals, reflecting the druid's role as a guardian of nature.
- **Seasonal Influences**: The effectiveness of some druid spells may be influenced by the season, the phase of the moon, or other natural cycles.
- **Reversibility**: Like cleric spells, many druid spells are reversible, allowing the druid to cast either the standard version or its opposite.
- **Components**: Druid spells typically require verbal and somatic components, and often material components drawn from nature, such as leaves, twigs, or stones.

## Acquiring and Preparing Druid Spells

Druids acquire and prepare spells through the following process:

- **Meditation**: Druids must spend time in meditation to acquire their spells. This typically takes 1 hour and must be done at a specific time of day, often dawn or dusk.
- **Natural Setting**: Druids typically need to be in a natural setting to prepare their spells. The more pristine and untouched the natural environment, the more effective the preparation.
- **Spell Selection**: During meditation, the druid selects which spells to prepare, up to the number of spells of each level they are allowed based on their druid level.
- **Wisdom Bonus**: Druids with high Wisdom receive bonus spells, similar to clerics, as shown in the following table:

| Wisdom | Bonus Spells by Spell Level |
|--------|----------------------------|
| 13     | 1st: +1                    |
| 14     | 1st: +2                    |
| 15     | 1st: +2, 2nd: +1           |
| 16     | 1st: +2, 2nd: +2           |
| 17     | 1st: +2, 2nd: +2, 3rd: +1  |
| 18     | 1st: +2, 2nd: +2, 3rd: +1, 4th: +1 |

## Casting Druid Spells

The casting of druid spells involves the following elements:

- **Casting Time**: Each spell has a casting time, representing how long it takes to cast the spell. This can range from a segment (1/10 of a round) to several rounds or even longer for complex rituals.
- **Verbal Component**: The druid must be able to speak to cast spells with verbal components. This includes most druid spells. The verbal components are often in the Druidic language, which is known only to druids.
- **Somatic Component**: The druid must be able to move their hands to cast spells with somatic components. This includes most druid spells. The somatic components often mimic natural movements, such as the swaying of trees or the flow of water.
- **Material Component**: Many druid spells require specific material components drawn from nature, which are consumed or used during casting.
- **Mistletoe**: Druids often use mistletoe as a focus for their spells. The quality of the mistletoe (fresh, preserved, or holly) affects the casting of the spell.

## Reversible Spells

Many druid spells are reversible, allowing the druid to cast either the standard version or its opposite. The following guidelines apply:

- **Preparation**: When a druid prepares a reversible spell, they must decide whether to prepare the standard version or the reversed version. They cannot switch between versions without re-preparing the spell.
- **Balance Considerations**: True Neutral druids, who seek to maintain the balance of nature, may use either version of reversible spells depending on what would best serve the balance in a given situation.
- **Natural Cycles**: The use of reversible spells may be influenced by natural cycles. For example, spells that promote growth might be favored in spring, while spells that cause decay might be favored in autumn.

## Environmental Influences

The natural environment can influence the casting and effects of druid spells:

- **Favorable Environments**: Druids casting spells in pristine natural environments may receive bonuses to their spellcasting, such as increased range, duration, or effect.
- **Unfavorable Environments**: Druids casting spells in heavily urbanized or polluted environments may suffer penalties to their spellcasting, such as reduced range, duration, or effect.
- **Seasonal Influences**: The effectiveness of druid spells may be influenced by the season. For example, plant-related spells might be more powerful in spring and summer, while weather-related spells might be more powerful in autumn and winter.
- **Elemental Affinities**: Certain environments may have affinities with specific elements, affecting spells related to those elements. For example, fire spells might be more powerful in a volcanic region, while water spells might be more powerful near a lake or ocean.

## Adjudicating Druid Spells

The DM should consider the following factors when adjudicating druid spells:

- **Natural Balance**: Druid spells should reflect the druid's role as a maintainer of natural balance. The DM should consider how the use of a spell affects this balance.
- **Environmental Context**: The DM should consider the natural environment in which a spell is cast, applying bonuses or penalties as appropriate.
- **Seasonal Context**: The DM should consider the season and other natural cycles when determining the effects of druid spells.
- **Alignment Restrictions**: The DM should enforce the True Neutral alignment requirement for druids, considering whether a druid's use of spells is consistent with this alignment.

## Specific Druid Spell Categories

Certain categories of druid spells raise specific adjudication issues:

- **Weather Control Spells**: Spells like call lightning and control weather raise questions about what weather conditions can be created and how they affect the environment and creatures within it. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the specific environment.
- **Plant Control Spells**: Spells like entangle and plant growth raise questions about what plants are affected and how they behave. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the specific plants present.
- **Animal Control Spells**: Spells like animal friendship and summon insects raise questions about what animals are affected and how they behave. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the specific animals present.
- **Elemental Spells**: Spells like produce flame and call woodland beings raise questions about the nature and behavior of the elemental forces or beings summoned. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the specific elements involved.

## Druidic Hierarchy and Spell Access

In some campaign settings, druids may be organized into a hierarchy, with higher-ranking druids having access to certain spells or spell variations not available to lower-ranking druids. The following guidelines apply:

- **Hierarchical Spells**: Certain spells may be restricted to druids of specific ranks within the druidic hierarchy. For example, the most powerful nature-altering spells might be available only to Archdruids or the Great Druid.
- **Ritual Knowledge**: Higher-ranking druids may possess knowledge of special rituals or spell variations that they can teach to lower-ranking druids who prove themselves worthy.
- **Sacred Groves**: Certain druidic spells may be castable only in sacred groves or other special natural locations, access to which is controlled by the druidic hierarchy.

## Conclusion

Druid spells add a natural dimension to the AD&D game, providing druids with a wide range of abilities that reflect their role as guardians of nature and maintainers of natural balance. The DM should use these guidelines to handle druid spells in a way that is balanced, consistent, and enhances the game experience for all players.
