# Cleric Spells

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Cleric spells in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are divine magic granted to clerics by their deities. This section provides detailed information on cleric spells and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling them in the campaign.

## Nature of Cleric Spells

Cleric spells have the following characteristics:

- **Divine Source**: Cleric spells are granted by deities or divine forces, not learned through study like magic-user spells. The cleric prays for spells, and the deity grants them.
- **Moral Alignment**: The spells available to a cleric may be influenced by the cleric's alignment and the alignment of their deity. Some spells may be restricted to good, neutral, or evil clerics.
- **Reversibility**: Many cleric spells are reversible, allowing the cleric to cast either the standard version or its opposite. For example, cure light wounds can be reversed to cause light wounds.
- **Spontaneous Casting**: Unlike magic-users, clerics do not need spell books. They can pray for any spell of a level they can cast, provided it is appropriate to their deity and alignment.
- **Components**: Cleric spells typically require verbal and somatic components, and sometimes material components. The verbal components are often prayers or invocations to the cleric's deity.

## Acquiring and Preparing Cleric Spells

Clerics acquire and prepare spells through the following process:

- **Prayer**: Clerics must spend time in prayer to acquire their spells. This typically takes 1 hour and must be done at a specific time of day, often dawn or dusk, depending on the cleric's deity.
- **Spell Selection**: During prayer, the cleric selects which spells to prepare, up to the number of spells of each level they are allowed based on their cleric level.
- **Divine Favor**: The granting of spells is an indication of the deity's favor. A cleric who has displeased their deity may find some or all of their spells unavailable until they atone.
- **Wisdom Bonus**: Clerics with high Wisdom receive bonus spells, as shown in the following table:

| Wisdom | Bonus Spells by Spell Level |
|--------|----------------------------|
| 13     | 1st: +1                    |
| 14     | 1st: +2                    |
| 15     | 1st: +2, 2nd: +1           |
| 16     | 1st: +2, 2nd: +2           |
| 17     | 1st: +2, 2nd: +2, 3rd: +1  |
| 18     | 1st: +2, 2nd: +2, 3rd: +1, 4th: +1 |

## Casting Cleric Spells

The casting of cleric spells involves the following elements:

- **Casting Time**: Each spell has a casting time, representing how long it takes to cast the spell. This can range from a segment (1/10 of a round) to several rounds or even longer for complex rituals.
- **Verbal Component**: The cleric must be able to speak to cast spells with verbal components. This includes most cleric spells.
- **Somatic Component**: The cleric must be able to move their hands to cast spells with somatic components. This includes most cleric spells.
- **Material Component**: Some cleric spells require specific material components, which are consumed or used during casting.
- **Holy Symbol**: Clerics must have their holy symbol to cast spells. The holy symbol serves as a focus for the divine power channeled by the cleric.

## Reversible Spells

Many cleric spells are reversible, allowing the cleric to cast either the standard version or its opposite. The following guidelines apply:

- **Preparation**: When a cleric prepares a reversible spell, they must decide whether to prepare the standard version or the reversed version. They cannot switch between versions without re-preparing the spell.
- **Alignment Considerations**: Good clerics typically prepare the beneficial versions of reversible spells, while evil clerics typically prepare the harmful versions. Neutral clerics may prepare either version, depending on their specific beliefs and the situation.
- **Deity Restrictions**: Some deities may restrict their clerics from using certain versions of reversible spells. For example, a deity of healing might forbid their clerics from using the reversed versions of healing spells.

## Spell Domains

In some campaign settings, clerics may have access to specific domains of spells based on their deity's portfolio. The following guidelines apply:

- **Domain Spells**: Each domain provides access to specific spells that are particularly relevant to the deity's areas of influence. For example, a deity of war might grant access to combat-enhancing spells, while a deity of healing might grant access to additional healing spells.
- **Domain Powers**: In addition to spells, domains may grant special powers or abilities to clerics. These powers are typically related to the domain's theme.
- **Multiple Domains**: Some clerics may have access to multiple domains, reflecting the diverse aspects of their deity's portfolio.

## Adjudicating Cleric Spells

The DM should consider the following factors when adjudicating cleric spells:

- **Divine Intervention**: Cleric spells represent direct intervention by the cleric's deity or divine force. The DM should consider how the deity's personality, goals, and alignment might influence the manifestation and effects of the spells.
- **Alignment Restrictions**: The DM should enforce alignment restrictions on cleric spells, ensuring that clerics only use spells appropriate to their alignment and their deity's alignment.
- **Divine Favor**: The DM should consider whether a cleric's actions have pleased or displeased their deity, and adjust the availability or effectiveness of spells accordingly.
- **Holy Ground**: The DM may rule that certain locations, such as temples or sacred sites, enhance or inhibit cleric spells based on the alignment and nature of the location and the cleric's deity.

## Specific Cleric Spell Categories

Certain categories of cleric spells raise specific adjudication issues:

- **Healing Spells**: Spells like cure light wounds and heal raise questions about what conditions can be cured and how much damage can be healed. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the specific injury or condition.
- **Divination Spells**: Spells like augury and commune raise questions about what information is revealed and how it is presented. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the specific question or situation.
- **Protection Spells**: Spells like protection from evil and sanctuary raise questions about what creatures are affected and what actions break the protection. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the specific situation.
- **Summoning Spells**: Spells like conjure animals and aerial servant raise questions about the behavior and capabilities of the summoned creatures. The DM should determine these details based on the spell description and the nature of the summoned creatures.

## Conclusion

Cleric spells add a divine dimension to the AD&D game, providing clerics with a wide range of abilities that reflect their role as intermediaries between the mortal world and the divine. The DM should use these guidelines to handle cleric spells in a way that is balanced, consistent, and enhances the game experience for all players.
