# Surprise

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Surprise is a crucial element of encounters in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, representing the advantage gained when one side catches another unprepared. This section provides detailed information on surprise and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling surprise in encounters.

## Nature of Surprise

Surprise in the AD&D game has the following characteristics:

- **Momentary Advantage**: Surprise represents a momentary advantage at the beginning of an encounter, when one side is caught unprepared by the appearance or actions of another.
- **Limited Duration**: Surprise typically lasts for a limited time, usually one round (one minute) or less, after which normal encounter procedures resume.
- **Tactical Significance**: Surprise can have significant tactical implications, allowing the surprising side to act while the surprised side is unable to respond effectively.
- **Situational Determination**: Whether surprise occurs depends on various factors, including the environment, the actions of the participants, and special abilities or circumstances.
- **Partial Possibility**: Surprise can be partial, with some members of a group being surprised while others are not, reflecting individual awareness and readiness.

## Determining Surprise

The DM determines whether surprise occurs at the beginning of an encounter:

- **Surprise Check**: Each side in the encounter makes a surprise check by rolling 1d6. A roll of 1 or 2 indicates that the side is surprised.
- **Modifying Factors**: Various factors can modify the surprise check or the likelihood of surprise:
  - **Environment**: Conditions such as darkness, fog, or dense vegetation can increase the chance of surprise.
  - **Noise**: Noisy activities, such as wearing metal armor, talking loudly, or moving carelessly, can decrease the chance of surprising others and increase the chance of being surprised.
  - **Alertness**: Characters or creatures who are specifically on alert, such as sentries or those who have reason to expect danger, may be less likely to be surprised.
  - **Special Abilities**: Some races, classes, or creatures have special abilities related to surprise, such as elves' and halflings' reduced chance of being surprised, or rangers' increased chance of surprising others.
- **Group Checks**: When a group includes multiple individuals, the DM may make a single surprise check for the entire group, or individual checks for each member, depending on the circumstances.
- **Mutual Surprise**: It is possible for both sides to be surprised simultaneously, in which case they both lose the opportunity to act during the surprise round.

## Effects of Surprise

When surprise occurs, it has several effects:

- **Surprise Round**: The surprising side gains a surprise round, during which they can act while the surprised side cannot.
- **Actions During Surprise**: During the surprise round, each member of the surprising side can typically perform one action, such as moving, attacking, casting a spell, or using an item.
- **Multiple Segments**: If one side achieves surprise by a significant margin (such as one side rolling a 1 for surprise while the other rolls a 5 or 6), the surprising side may gain multiple segments of surprise, allowing more actions or more complex actions.
- **Initiative After Surprise**: After the surprise round, normal initiative procedures begin, with both sides rolling for initiative and acting accordingly.
- **Dexterity Adjustment**: Characters with high Dexterity may be able to act during a surprise round even if their side is generally surprised, while characters with low Dexterity may be unable to act during a surprise round even if their side is generally not surprised.

## Surprise in Different Environments

The likelihood and nature of surprise can vary in different environments:

- **Dungeon Environments**: In dungeons and other enclosed spaces, surprise is often determined by factors such as light sources, noise, and the layout of corridors and rooms. Doors, corners, and other features can create opportunities for surprise.
- **Wilderness Environments**: In wilderness areas, surprise is often determined by factors such as terrain, vegetation, weather conditions, and the distance between the parties. The openness of wilderness areas can make surprise less likely, but natural features can create opportunities.
- **Urban Environments**: In urban areas, surprise is often determined by factors such as crowds, buildings, alleys, and the social context. The complexity of urban environments can create many opportunities for surprise, but the presence of other people can make it more difficult to act without being noticed.
- **Special Environments**: Some environments, such as underwater, aerial, or extraplanar settings, may have unique factors that affect surprise, such as visibility conditions, movement capabilities, or unusual sensory perceptions.

## Avoiding and Achieving Surprise

Characters and creatures can take various actions to avoid being surprised or to increase their chances of surprising others:

- **Avoiding Surprise**:
  - **Maintaining Alertness**: Characters who explicitly state that they are being alert and watchful may receive bonuses to avoid being surprised.
  - **Using Scouts**: Groups can send scouts ahead to detect potential threats before the main group encounters them.
  - **Using Light Sources**: In dark environments, using light sources can reveal potential threats before they can achieve surprise, though it also makes the characters more visible to others.
  - **Making Noise**: Deliberately making noise can alert potential threats to the characters' presence, preventing the threats from being surprised but also reducing the chance that the characters will be surprised.
  - **Using Magic**: Spells such as detect invisible, clairvoyance, or wizard eye can reveal hidden threats before they can achieve surprise.

- **Achieving Surprise**:
  - **Moving Silently**: Characters can attempt to move silently to avoid alerting potential targets to their presence.
  - **Hiding**: Characters can hide in shadows, behind cover, or using camouflage to avoid being seen until they choose to reveal themselves.
  - **Using Distractions**: Creating distractions can draw attention away from the characters, allowing them to approach unnoticed.
  - **Using Magic**: Spells such as invisibility, silence, or illusions can help characters approach targets without being detected.
  - **Planning Ambushes**: Characters can plan and execute ambushes, using terrain features, timing, and coordination to maximize the chance of surprising targets.

## Special Cases of Surprise

Certain special cases of surprise require specific handling:

- **Invisible Attackers**: Invisible attackers typically gain surprise unless the target has the ability to detect invisibility or is specifically on guard against invisible threats.
- **Ethereal or Astral Attackers**: Attackers from the Ethereal or Astral Plane typically gain surprise when they materialize, unless the target has the ability to perceive ethereal or astral forms.
- **Backstabbing**: Thieves attempting to backstab typically need to achieve surprise to use this ability effectively, requiring successful stealth or deception.
- **Ambushes**: Planned ambushes, where one side is specifically waiting in a prepared position to attack another, typically have a high chance of achieving surprise.
- **Parleys**: When two sides are engaged in parley or negotiation, one side may attempt to achieve surprise by suddenly attacking. This is typically resolved with a surprise check, possibly with modifiers based on the specific circumstances.

## Conclusion

Surprise is a crucial element of encounters in the AD&D game, providing a significant tactical advantage to the side that achieves it. The DM should handle surprise in a way that is fair, consistent, and reflective of the specific circumstances of each encounter. By considering the factors that affect surprise, the effects of surprise, and the strategies for avoiding or achieving surprise, the DM can create more dynamic and realistic encounters that reward player skill and tactical thinking.
