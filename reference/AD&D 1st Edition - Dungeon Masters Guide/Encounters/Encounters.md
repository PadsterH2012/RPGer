# Encounters

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Encounters are the building blocks of adventures in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, representing specific situations where player characters interact with monsters, non-player characters (NPCs), or the environment. This section provides an overview of encounters and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on creating and running them in the campaign.

## Types of Encounters

There are several types of encounters in the AD&D game:

- **Combat Encounters**: These involve conflict between the player characters and monsters or NPCs, typically resolved through the combat system. They test the characters' fighting abilities, tactical skills, and resource management.
- **Social Encounters**: These involve interaction between the player characters and NPCs, typically resolved through role-playing and possibly ability checks or reaction rolls. They test the characters' social skills, diplomacy, and understanding of the campaign world.
- **Exploration Encounters**: These involve the player characters investigating or navigating the environment, typically resolved through description, mapping, and possibly ability checks or special procedures. They test the characters' perception, knowledge, and problem-solving abilities.
- **Trap Encounters**: These involve the player characters discovering and dealing with traps or hazards, typically resolved through special procedures for detection, disarming, or avoidance. They test the characters' perception, caution, and technical skills.
- **Puzzle Encounters**: These involve the player characters solving puzzles or riddles, typically resolved through player ingenuity rather than character abilities. They test the players' problem-solving skills and creativity.
- **Resource Encounters**: These involve the player characters finding, managing, or using resources such as treasure, equipment, or information. They test the characters' resource management and decision-making.

## Encounter Design

The DM should consider the following factors when designing encounters:

- **Purpose**: Each encounter should have a clear purpose in the adventure, such as advancing the plot, providing information, testing the characters' abilities, or offering rewards.
- **Challenge Level**: The difficulty of the encounter should be appropriate for the characters' level and abilities, providing a meaningful challenge without being impossible or trivial.
- **Variety**: The adventure should include a variety of encounter types, avoiding repetition and allowing different character types to shine in different situations.
- **Context**: Each encounter should make sense in the context of the location, the campaign world, and the overall adventure, with logical reasons for the presence and behavior of monsters, NPCs, or environmental features.
- **Interconnection**: Encounters should be interconnected where appropriate, with the outcome of one encounter potentially affecting others, creating a dynamic and responsive adventure environment.

## Random Encounters

Random encounters are unplanned encounters determined by dice rolls:

- **Encounter Tables**: The DM can create or use published encounter tables specific to different environments, such as dungeons, wilderness areas, or settlements, listing potential encounters and their probability.
- **Encounter Frequency**: The DM determines how often to check for random encounters, typically once per turn (10 minutes) in dungeons, once per hour in wilderness areas, or once per day in settled areas.
- **Encounter Probability**: The DM determines the probability of an encounter occurring when a check is made, typically 1 in 6 in dungeons, 1 in 10 in wilderness areas, or 1 in 20 in settled areas.
- **Encounter Distance**: The DM determines the initial distance between the characters and the encountered creatures, typically based on the environment, visibility conditions, and the nature of the creatures.
- **Encounter Reaction**: The DM determines the initial reaction of encountered creatures, typically using the reaction table and considering factors such as the creatures' nature, the characters' approach, and the specific circumstances.

## Planned Encounters

Planned encounters are designed in advance as part of the adventure:

- **Key Encounters**: These are significant encounters that are central to the adventure, such as confrontations with major villains, discovery of crucial information, or acquisition of important items.
- **Supporting Encounters**: These are secondary encounters that provide context, challenges, or resources that support the key encounters, such as minion battles, information sources, or resource opportunities.
- **Environmental Encounters**: These are encounters that establish or reinforce the nature of the environment, such as weather conditions, terrain features, or ambient creatures.
- **Transitional Encounters**: These are encounters that facilitate movement between different parts of the adventure, such as guardians of passages, transportation opportunities, or boundary markers.
- **Optional Encounters**: These are encounters that players may or may not experience depending on their choices, providing additional depth, challenges, or rewards for thorough exploration.

## Running Encounters

The DM should consider the following factors when running encounters:

- **Preparation**: The DM should prepare for key encounters by familiarizing themselves with the relevant rules, monster statistics, NPC motivations, or environmental features, and by gathering any necessary maps, handouts, or other materials.
- **Description**: The DM should provide clear and evocative descriptions of the encounter situation, helping players visualize the scene and understand their options.
- **Pacing**: The DM should manage the pace of the encounter, ensuring that it maintains momentum and interest without rushing or dragging.
- **Flexibility**: The DM should be prepared to adapt the encounter to unexpected player actions or decisions, adjusting monsters, NPCs, or environmental elements as needed.
- **Resolution**: The DM should ensure clear resolution of the encounter, including the immediate outcome, any rewards or consequences, and the transition to the next part of the adventure.

## Encounter Balance

Balancing encounters is crucial for a satisfying game experience:

- **Party Composition**: The DM should consider the composition of the party, including the number of characters, their classes, levels, abilities, and equipment, when determining appropriate challenges.
- **Monster Selection**: The DM should select monsters or NPCs that provide an appropriate challenge level, considering their hit dice, special abilities, and tactics relative to the party's capabilities.
- **Numerical Balance**: The DM should consider the number of opponents relative to the number of characters, recognizing that a large number of weaker opponents can be as challenging as a small number of stronger ones.
- **Environmental Factors**: The DM should consider how the environment affects the encounter balance, such as terrain advantages, visibility conditions, or special features that can be used tactically.
- **Resource Depletion**: The DM should consider the party's resource state, including hit points, spells, and consumable items, recognizing that a series of encounters without rest can be more challenging than isolated encounters.

## Rewards and Consequences

Encounters typically have rewards and consequences:

- **Experience Points**: Characters earn experience points for overcoming challenges, with the amount based on the difficulty of the encounter and the method of resolution.
- **Treasure**: Characters may find treasure as a result of encounters, including coins, gems, jewelry, magical items, or other valuable items.
- **Information**: Characters may gain information from encounters, including knowledge about the campaign world, clues for solving puzzles or quests, or insights into NPCs or monsters.
- **Reputation**: Characters may gain or lose reputation as a result of encounters, affecting how NPCs and factions perceive and interact with them.
- **Resources**: Characters may gain or lose resources as a result of encounters, including hit points, spells, equipment, or consumable items.

## Conclusion

Encounters are the fundamental building blocks of adventures in the AD&D game, providing the specific situations where player characters interact with the campaign world. The DM should use these guidelines to create and run encounters that are balanced, varied, and meaningful, contributing to an engaging and enjoyable game experience for all participants.
