# Reactions

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Reactions in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game represent how non-player characters (NPCs) and monsters initially respond to encounters with player characters. This section provides detailed information on reactions and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on determining and using reactions in the campaign.

## Nature of Reactions

Reactions in the AD&D game have the following characteristics:

- **Initial Attitude**: Reactions represent the initial attitude or disposition of NPCs or monsters toward the player characters at the beginning of an encounter.
- **Range of Responses**: Reactions can range from hostile (leading to immediate attack) to friendly (leading to cooperation or assistance), with various gradations in between.
- **Situational Influence**: Reactions are influenced by various situational factors, including the nature of the creatures involved, the circumstances of the encounter, and the actions of the player characters.
- **Dynamic Nature**: Reactions can change during an encounter based on the behavior of the player characters, the course of events, and other factors.
- **Probabilistic Determination**: Reactions are typically determined through dice rolls on a reaction table, modified by various factors to reflect the specific circumstances.

## The Reaction Table

The standard reaction table uses 2d10 to determine the initial reaction of NPCs or monsters:

| 2d10 Roll | Reaction                                                |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 2         | Immediate attack                                        |
| 3-5       | Hostile, possible attack                                |
| 6-8       | Uncertain, cautious                                     |
| 9-11      | Neutral, uninterested                                   |
| 12-18     | Friendly, helpful                                       |
| 19-20     | Enthusiastic, loyal                                     |

## Reaction Modifiers

Various factors can modify the reaction roll:

- **Charisma**: The Charisma of the character leading the interaction provides a modifier to the reaction roll, as shown in the following table:

| Charisma | Reaction Adjustment |
|----------|---------------------|
| 3        | -5                  |
| 4-5      | -3                  |
| 6-8      | -1                  |
| 9-12     | 0                   |
| 13-15    | +1                  |
| 16-17    | +2                  |
| 18       | +3                  |

- **Racial Attitudes**: Some races have natural affinities or antipathies toward others, providing bonuses or penalties to reaction rolls. For example:
  - Dwarves and elves may have penalties when interacting with each other.
  - Halflings may have bonuses when interacting with humans.
  - Orcs may have penalties when interacting with elves or dwarves.
- **Alignment**: Alignment differences can affect reactions, with greater differences typically resulting in penalties to reaction rolls.
- **Prior Interactions**: Previous interactions between the parties can significantly affect reactions, with positive past experiences providing bonuses and negative past experiences providing penalties.
- **Gifts or Offerings**: Appropriate gifts or offerings can improve reactions, with the bonus depending on the value and appropriateness of the gift.
- **Approach Method**: How the player characters approach the encounter can affect reactions, with respectful or cautious approaches typically providing bonuses and aggressive or disrespectful approaches providing penalties.
- **Specific Circumstances**: Various specific circumstances can affect reactions, such as territorial intrusion, resource competition, or common threats.

## When to Check Reactions

The DM should check reactions in the following situations:

- **Initial Encounters**: When player characters first encounter NPCs or monsters with whom interaction is possible, a reaction check determines the initial attitude.
- **Significant Changes**: When there is a significant change in the circumstances of an ongoing encounter, such as the introduction of new participants, the revelation of important information, or a dramatic action by one of the parties.
- **Negotiation Attempts**: When player characters attempt to negotiate, persuade, or otherwise influence NPCs or monsters, a reaction check can determine the response to their efforts.
- **Uncertain Situations**: When the DM is uncertain how NPCs or monsters would react to a particular situation, a reaction check can provide guidance.
- **Random Encounters**: For random encounters, a reaction check is typically part of the encounter resolution, helping to determine the nature of the encounter.

## Interpreting Reactions

The DM should interpret reaction results based on the specific circumstances:

- **Immediate Attack**: The NPCs or monsters attack without hesitation or negotiation, seeking to defeat or drive away the player characters.
- **Hostile, Possible Attack**: The NPCs or monsters are hostile and may attack if they feel threatened or see an advantage, but might be willing to parley or be intimidated into withdrawal.
- **Uncertain, Cautious**: The NPCs or monsters are wary and uncertain, neither immediately hostile nor friendly. They may ask questions, make demands, or take defensive positions while assessing the situation.
- **Neutral, Uninterested**: The NPCs or monsters are neither hostile nor particularly friendly. They may ignore the player characters if possible, or interact minimally if necessary.
- **Friendly, Helpful**: The NPCs or monsters are positively disposed toward the player characters and may offer information, assistance, or cooperation, within reasonable limits.
- **Enthusiastic, Loyal**: The NPCs or monsters are extremely well-disposed toward the player characters and may offer significant assistance, join them temporarily, or form lasting alliances.

## Reaction and Intelligence

The intelligence of NPCs or monsters affects how reactions are determined and interpreted:

- **Non-Intelligent Creatures**: Creatures with animal-level intelligence or lower typically react based on instinct rather than reason. Their reactions are more predictable and less influenced by factors such as Charisma or negotiation attempts.
- **Semi-Intelligent Creatures**: Creatures with limited intelligence can understand basic concepts and may be influenced by obvious displays of strength, submission, or offering of food, but are less responsive to complex negotiation or subtle social cues.
- **Intelligent Creatures**: Creatures with human-level intelligence or higher can understand complex situations, be influenced by reasoned arguments or appeals to self-interest, and may have sophisticated motivations that affect their reactions.
- **Highly Intelligent Creatures**: Creatures with exceptional intelligence may see through deception, anticipate consequences, or have complex plans that influence their reactions in ways that may not be immediately apparent.

## Changing Reactions

Reactions can change during an encounter based on various factors:

- **Player Character Actions**: The actions of player characters can significantly affect reactions, with respectful, helpful, or impressive actions improving reactions and disrespectful, threatening, or incompetent actions worsening them.
- **Communication**: Effective communication can improve reactions, while poor communication or misunderstandings can worsen them. Language barriers can make communication difficult and may affect reactions negatively.
- **Negotiation**: Successful negotiation can improve reactions, particularly if the player characters can identify and address the concerns or desires of the NPCs or monsters.
- **Changing Circumstances**: Changes in the circumstances of the encounter, such as the arrival of new participants, the discovery of common enemies, or changes in the environment, can affect reactions.
- **Time Passage**: As an encounter progresses, initial reactions may shift based on extended interaction, observation of behavior, or simply the passage of time allowing for better assessment.

## Using Reactions in Play

The DM should consider the following factors when using reactions in play:

- **Consistency**: Reactions should be consistent with the nature, intelligence, and motivations of the NPCs or monsters, as well as with established facts about the campaign world.
- **Flexibility**: While the reaction table provides a framework, the DM should be flexible in interpreting results based on the specific circumstances and the needs of the game.
- **Player Agency**: Reactions should be influenced by player decisions and actions, allowing players to affect the outcome of encounters through their choices.
- **NPC Individuality**: Individual NPCs may react differently from others of their kind based on personal characteristics, experiences, or circumstances.
- **Campaign Integration**: Reactions should be integrated into the broader campaign, with significant interactions potentially having long-term consequences for relationships, reputation, and future encounters.

## Conclusion

Reactions are a crucial element of encounters in the AD&D game, determining how NPCs and monsters initially respond to player characters and setting the tone for the interaction that follows. The DM should use the reaction system to create diverse and realistic encounters that respond to player actions and decisions, while also reflecting the nature and motivations of the NPCs and monsters involved. By considering the factors that affect reactions and interpreting results in a way that is consistent with the specific circumstances, the DM can create more dynamic and engaging encounters that reward player skill and role-playing.
