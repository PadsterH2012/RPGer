# Encounter Distance

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Encounter distance is the initial distance between the player characters and the creatures or non-player characters (NPCs) they encounter. This section provides detailed information on encounter distances and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on determining and using encounter distances in the campaign.

## Importance of Encounter Distance

Encounter distance is a crucial factor that affects how encounters unfold:

- **Tactical Options**: The initial distance between the parties determines what tactical options are available, such as whether ranged weapons can be used effectively, whether spells with limited range can be cast, or whether charging is possible.
- **Reaction Time**: Greater distance provides more time for parties to assess the situation, make decisions, and prepare for potential conflict, while shorter distance forces more immediate reactions.
- **Surprise Implications**: Encounter distance interacts with surprise, as a surprised party at a greater distance may still have time to react before the surprising party can close to melee range.
- **Environment Interaction**: The distance at which an encounter begins affects how the environment can be used tactically, such as using terrain features for cover or positioning for advantage.
- **Escape Possibilities**: Greater initial distance makes escape more feasible for either party, while shorter distance may make escape difficult or impossible without engaging in combat.

## Determining Encounter Distance

The DM determines the initial distance for an encounter based on various factors:

- **Environment Type**: The type of environment significantly affects encounter distances:
  - **Dungeon Environments**: In dungeons and other enclosed spaces, encounter distances are typically short, often 10-60 feet, limited by walls, doors, and corridors.
  - **Wilderness Environments**: In wilderness areas, encounter distances can be much greater, often 10-300 yards, depending on terrain and visibility.
  - **Urban Environments**: In urban areas, encounter distances are typically moderate, often 10-120 feet, limited by buildings, streets, and crowds.
- **Visibility Conditions**: Conditions that affect visibility, such as lighting, weather, or magical effects, can reduce encounter distances:
  - **Darkness**: In darkness, encounter distances are typically limited to the range of light sources or darkvision.
  - **Fog or Mist**: In fog or mist, encounter distances may be reduced to 10-30 feet, depending on the density.
  - **Rain or Snow**: In rain or snow, encounter distances may be reduced to 30-100 feet, depending on the intensity.
- **Terrain Features**: Features of the terrain can affect encounter distances:
  - **Open Terrain**: In open terrain, such as plains or deserts, encounter distances can be very large, limited mainly by visibility conditions.
  - **Dense Vegetation**: In dense vegetation, such as forests or jungles, encounter distances are typically reduced to 10-30 feet.
  - **Hills or Valleys**: In hilly or mountainous terrain, encounter distances can vary widely, as hills can block line of sight but also provide vantage points.
- **Noise Factors**: Noise can affect when creatures become aware of each other, influencing encounter distance:
  - **Quiet Conditions**: In quiet conditions, creatures may hear each other before seeing each other, potentially increasing encounter distance.
  - **Noisy Conditions**: In noisy conditions, such as during a storm or near a waterfall, creatures may not hear each other until they are in visual range, potentially decreasing encounter distance.
- **Surprise Status**: Whether one or both parties are surprised affects the effective encounter distance:
  - **No Surprise**: If neither party is surprised, the encounter begins at the distance determined by the environment and other factors.
  - **One Party Surprised**: If one party is surprised, the encounter effectively begins at a shorter distance, as the surprised party does not react until the surprise round is over.
  - **Both Parties Surprised**: If both parties are surprised, the encounter effectively begins at the determined distance after the surprise round.

## Random Determination of Encounter Distance

For random encounters, the DM can use dice to determine the initial distance:

- **Dungeon Encounters**: For dungeon encounters, roll 2d6 × 10 feet to determine the encounter distance. This gives a range of 20-120 feet, with an average of 70 feet.
- **Wilderness Encounters**: For wilderness encounters, the method depends on the terrain type:
  - **Open Terrain**: Roll 4d6 × 10 yards for encounter distance in open terrain, giving a range of 40-240 yards.
  - **Scrub or Brush**: Roll 3d6 × 10 yards for encounter distance in scrub or brush, giving a range of 30-180 yards.
  - **Forest or Woods**: Roll 2d6 × 10 yards for encounter distance in forest or woods, giving a range of 20-120 yards.
  - **Dense Forest or Jungle**: Roll 1d6 × 10 yards for encounter distance in dense forest or jungle, giving a range of 10-60 yards.
- **Urban Encounters**: For urban encounters, roll 1d10 × 10 feet to determine the encounter distance. This gives a range of 10-100 feet, with an average of 55 feet.
- **Special Environments**: For special environments, such as underwater, aerial, or extraplanar settings, the DM should adapt these methods or create specific tables based on the nature of the environment.

## Modifying Encounter Distance

The DM can modify the randomly determined encounter distance based on specific circumstances:

- **Visibility Modifiers**: Reduce the encounter distance by 25-75% in conditions of limited visibility, such as darkness, fog, or heavy precipitation.
- **Terrain Modifiers**: Reduce the encounter distance by 25-50% in terrain with many obstacles or limited lines of sight, such as dense vegetation, rugged terrain, or complex urban environments.
- **Alertness Modifiers**: Increase the encounter distance by 25-50% if one or both parties are specifically on alert or actively searching for others.
- **Special Ability Modifiers**: Modify the encounter distance based on special abilities, such as increased for keen senses or decreased for limited perception.
- **Situational Modifiers**: Adjust the encounter distance based on specific situational factors, such as the presence of scouts, the use of magic, or the nature of the encounter.

## Using Encounter Distance in Play

The DM should consider the following factors when using encounter distance in play:

- **Clear Communication**: Clearly communicate the initial encounter distance to the players, helping them visualize the scene and understand their tactical options.
- **Movement Tracking**: Track the movement of both parties during the encounter, updating the distance between them as they move closer or farther apart.
- **Range Considerations**: Consider the range of weapons, spells, and special abilities when determining how the encounter unfolds, ensuring that distance affects tactical options realistically.
- **Environment Integration**: Integrate the environment into the encounter, considering how terrain features, obstacles, and other elements affect movement and visibility at the given distance.
- **Tactical Implications**: Consider the tactical implications of the encounter distance for both parties, including their likely strategies and the potential outcomes of different approaches.

## Conclusion

Encounter distance is a crucial factor that significantly affects how encounters unfold in the AD&D game. The DM should determine encounter distances that are appropriate for the environment, visibility conditions, and specific circumstances of each encounter, creating realistic and tactically interesting situations. By considering the factors that affect encounter distance and using it effectively in play, the DM can create more dynamic and engaging encounters that reward player skill and tactical thinking.
