# Random Encounters

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Random encounters in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game are encounters that are determined by dice rolls on tables rather than being specifically placed and designed by the Dungeon Master (DM). This section provides detailed information on random encounters and guidance for the DM on creating and using random encounter tables effectively.

## Purpose of Random Encounters

Random encounters serve several important purposes in the AD&D game:

- **Unpredictability**: Random encounters introduce an element of unpredictability and surprise, creating situations that neither the players nor the DM may have anticipated.
- **Resource Management**: Random encounters test the characters' resource management, as they must conserve hit points, spells, and consumable items to handle both planned and unplanned challenges.
- **Time Pressure**: The possibility of random encounters creates time pressure, discouraging excessive caution, lengthy debates, or unnecessary delays in dangerous areas.
- **World Dynamism**: Random encounters help create the impression of a dynamic, living world where events occur independently of the characters' main quest or storyline.
- **Exploration Risk**: Random encounters provide a risk associated with exploration, making the decision to explore new areas or spend extended time in dangerous locations meaningful.
- **Campaign Expansion**: Random encounters can introduce new elements, characters, or plot hooks that may develop into significant aspects of the campaign.

## Random Encounter Checks

The DM makes random encounter checks at regular intervals:

- **Dungeon Environments**: In dungeons and other enclosed spaces, random encounter checks are typically made once per turn (10 minutes of game time), with a 1 in 6 chance of an encounter occurring.
- **Wilderness Environments**: In wilderness areas, random encounter checks are typically made once per day and once per night, with a 1 in 10 chance of an encounter occurring during each period.
- **Urban Environments**: In urban areas, random encounter checks are typically made once per day and once per night, with a 1 in 20 chance of an encounter occurring during each period.
- **Special Environments**: In special environments, such as underwater, aerial, or extraplanar settings, the frequency and probability of random encounters should be adjusted based on the nature of the environment.
- **Modified Frequencies**: The DM may modify the frequency or probability of random encounters based on specific circumstances, such as:
  - **High-Traffic Areas**: Areas with high monster or NPC activity may have more frequent checks or higher probabilities.
  - **Noisy Activities**: Characters engaging in noisy activities, such as combat, loud arguments, or breaking down doors, may trigger additional encounter checks.
  - **Stealth**: Characters moving stealthily or taking precautions to avoid notice may have reduced probabilities of random encounters.
  - **Time of Day**: Certain times of day may have higher or lower probabilities of encounters, depending on the activity patterns of local creatures.

## Random Encounter Tables

Random encounter tables are used to determine what is encountered:

- **Environment-Specific Tables**: Different environments, such as dungeons, forests, mountains, deserts, or cities, have different encounter tables reflecting the creatures and situations appropriate to those environments.
- **Level-Specific Tables**: Dungeon encounter tables are often specific to the dungeon level, with higher levels featuring more powerful and dangerous encounters.
- **Time-Specific Tables**: Some environments may have different encounter tables for different times of day or night, reflecting the different creatures active during those periods.
- **Special Condition Tables**: Special conditions, such as storms, festivals, or magical effects, may have their own encounter tables or modify the results of standard tables.
- **Table Structure**: Encounter tables typically list potential encounters with their probability of occurrence, often expressed as a range of numbers on a d100 or other die roll.

## Creating Random Encounter Tables

The DM should consider the following factors when creating random encounter tables:

- **Environment Appropriateness**: Encounters should be appropriate for the environment, including creatures that would logically inhabit or visit the area.
- **Challenge Level**: Encounters should provide an appropriate level of challenge for the characters who will face them, with a range from relatively easy to quite difficult.
- **Variety**: Tables should include a variety of encounter types, including combat encounters, social encounters, and environmental encounters, to create diverse experiences.
- **Frequency Distribution**: More common or typical encounters should have a higher probability of occurring, while rarer or more unusual encounters should have a lower probability.
- **Special Entries**: Tables may include special entries that trigger unique or unusual situations, such as natural phenomena, special NPCs, or rare monsters.
- **Nested Tables**: Some entries on a table may refer to other tables, allowing for more detailed or varied results. For example, an entry for "humanoid patrol" might refer to a subtable that determines the specific type of humanoid.

## Example Random Encounter Table

The following is an example of a random encounter table for a temperate forest:

## Running Random Encounters

The DM should consider the following factors when running random encounters:

- **Context Integration**: Even though the encounter is randomly determined, the DM should integrate it into the context of the current situation, considering factors such as the time of day, recent events, and the specific location.
- **Logical Placement**: The DM should place the encountered creatures or NPCs in a logical location within the current environment, considering factors such as their habits, needs, and activities.
- **Encounter Distance**: The DM should determine the initial distance between the characters and the encountered creatures or NPCs, considering factors such as visibility, noise, and the nature of the creatures.
- **Surprise**: The DM should determine whether either side is surprised, following the standard surprise rules and considering any special circumstances.
- **Reaction**: The DM should determine the initial reaction of encountered creatures or NPCs, using the reaction table and considering factors such as their nature, the characters' approach, and the specific circumstances.
- **Development**: The DM should develop the encounter beyond the initial meeting, considering how it might evolve based on the actions of both the characters and the encountered creatures or NPCs.

## Enhancing Random Encounters

The DM can enhance random encounters to make them more interesting and meaningful:

- **Backstory**: Develop a brief backstory for encountered creatures or NPCs, explaining why they are in the area and what they are doing.
- **Personality**: Give encountered creatures or NPCs distinct personalities, motivations, and behaviors, making them more than just statistics.
- **Environmental Integration**: Integrate the encounter with the specific features of the environment, such as terrain, weather, or structures, creating a more vivid and realistic scene.
- **Connections**: Create connections between random encounters and other elements of the campaign, such as recurring NPCs, ongoing plots, or significant locations.
- **Consequences**: Consider the potential consequences of the encounter, both immediate and long-term, for the characters, the encountered creatures or NPCs, and the campaign world.
- **Player Agency**: Allow player decisions and actions to significantly affect the outcome of the encounter, rather than treating it as a predetermined event.

## Conclusion

Random encounters are a valuable tool for the DM, adding unpredictability, resource management challenges, time pressure, and world dynamism to the AD&D game. By creating thoughtful random encounter tables, making appropriate checks, and running encounters in a way that integrates them into the context of the campaign, the DM can use random encounters to enhance the game experience and create memorable moments. While random encounters are determined by dice rolls, they need not be disconnected or meaningless events, but can be developed into significant and engaging parts of the adventure.
