# Evasion and Pursuit

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Not all encounters in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game lead to combat. Sometimes, one side may attempt to evade the other, leading to a pursuit. This section provides detailed information on evasion and pursuit and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling these situations in the campaign.

## Decision to Evade

The decision to evade an encounter can be made by either player characters or non-player characters (NPCs):

- **Player Character Evasion**: Players may decide that their characters will attempt to evade an encounter for various reasons, such as being outnumbered, conserving resources, having other priorities, or recognizing a threat they cannot handle.
- **NPC Evasion**: The DM determines whether NPCs or monsters attempt to evade an encounter based on their nature, intelligence, morale, and the specific circumstances. Factors that might influence this decision include:
  - **Relative Strength**: Creatures that recognize they are significantly outmatched may attempt to evade.
  - **Morale**: Creatures with low morale or that have suffered significant losses may attempt to evade.
  - **Mission or Purpose**: Creatures with specific missions or purposes may evade encounters that would distract from or endanger their primary objective.
  - **Territory**: Creatures outside their normal territory may be more likely to evade encounters than those defending their home.
  - **Nature**: Some creatures are naturally timid or cautious and may attempt to evade most encounters.

## Evasion Procedure

When one side decides to evade an encounter, the following procedure applies:

- **Evasion Declaration**: The evading side declares their intention to evade, either through player announcement or DM decision for NPCs.
- **Surprise Consideration**: If the evading side has achieved surprise, they may be able to evade without the other side even being aware of their presence, automatically succeeding in their evasion attempt.
- **Distance Consideration**: The initial encounter distance significantly affects the likelihood of successful evasion. Greater distance provides more opportunity for evasion, while shorter distance makes evasion more difficult.
- **Pursuit Decision**: The other side must decide whether to pursue. Player characters make this decision themselves, while the DM determines whether NPCs or monsters pursue based on their nature, intelligence, and the specific circumstances.
- **Evasion Check**: If pursuit is attempted, an evasion check is made to determine whether the evading side successfully escapes or whether pursuit continues.

## Factors Affecting Evasion

Several factors affect the likelihood of successful evasion:

- **Movement Rates**: The relative movement rates of the evading and pursuing parties are crucial. If the evading party is faster, evasion is more likely to succeed. If the pursuing party is faster, evasion is less likely to succeed.
- **Terrain**: The nature of the terrain affects evasion:
  - **Open Terrain**: Evasion is more difficult in open terrain, as there are fewer places to hide and fewer obstacles to slow pursuers.
  - **Dense Vegetation**: Evasion is easier in dense vegetation, which provides hiding places and can slow pursuers.
  - **Rough Terrain**: Evasion can be easier in rough terrain if the evading party is more adept at navigating it than the pursuers.
  - **Urban Environment**: Evasion in urban environments depends on factors such as knowledge of the area, crowd density, and the availability of hiding places.
- **Visibility Conditions**: Conditions that limit visibility, such as darkness, fog, or precipitation, generally make evasion easier.
- **Special Abilities**: Special abilities can affect evasion, such as the ability to fly, climb, swim, turn invisible, or move silently.
- **Encumbrance**: Heavy encumbrance can reduce movement rate and make evasion more difficult.
- **Group Size**: Larger groups are generally more difficult to hide and may make more noise, making evasion more difficult.

## Pursuit Procedure

If one side decides to pursue the evading side, the following procedure applies:

- **Pursuit Declaration**: The pursuing side declares their intention to pursue, either through player announcement or DM decision for NPCs.
- **Initial Pursuit Check**: An initial check is made to determine whether the pursuit begins successfully or whether the evading side escapes immediately. This check is influenced by factors such as surprise, initial distance, and the environment.
- **Pursuit Round**: If the initial pursuit check indicates that pursuit continues, the situation is resolved in pursuit rounds, each representing a period of time appropriate to the environment (such as 1 turn in a dungeon or 1 hour in wilderness).
- **Movement Calculation**: During each pursuit round, the distance between the parties is calculated based on their movement rates and any modifiers from terrain, encumbrance, or special circumstances.
- **Evasion Attempts**: During pursuit, the evading side may attempt specific evasion tactics, such as hiding, doubling back, splitting up, or using special abilities or magic.
- **Pursuit Termination**: Pursuit continues until one of the following occurs:
  - The evading side successfully escapes, either by outrunning the pursuers or by successfully hiding or otherwise breaking contact.
  - The pursuing side catches up to the evading side, resulting in an encounter.
  - The pursuing side abandons the pursuit, either due to losing track of the evading side, exhaustion, or changing priorities.

## Specific Evasion Tactics

The evading side may employ various tactics to increase their chances of successful evasion:

- **Hiding**: The evading side may attempt to hide, using terrain features, darkness, or other concealment to break line of sight with pursuers.
- **Doubling Back**: The evading side may double back on their own trail, attempting to confuse pursuers or lead them in the wrong direction.
- **False Trails**: The evading side may create false trails to mislead pursuers, such as by splitting up temporarily and then rejoining, or by using magic or special abilities to create misleading tracks.
- **Using Terrain**: The evading side may use terrain features to their advantage, such as crossing rivers, climbing cliffs, or navigating dense vegetation that might slow or stop pursuers.
- **Magical Assistance**: The evading side may use magic to aid their evasion, such as spells that increase movement rate, create illusions, or render them invisible.
- **Distractions**: The evading side may create distractions to draw pursuers away, such as loud noises, visible movement in a different direction, or even sacrificing some resources to occupy the pursuers.

## Specific Pursuit Tactics

The pursuing side may employ various tactics to increase their chances of successful pursuit:

- **Tracking**: The pursuing side may use tracking skills to follow the evading side's trail, particularly in environments where tracks are visible.
- **Splitting Up**: The pursuing side may split up to cover more ground or to follow multiple possible routes that the evading side might have taken.
- **Using High Ground**: The pursuing side may use high ground to gain a better view of the surrounding area, potentially spotting the evading side.
- **Magical Assistance**: The pursuing side may use magic to aid their pursuit, such as spells that reveal tracks, increase movement rate, or allow them to see invisible creatures.
- **Local Knowledge**: The pursuing side may use knowledge of the local area to anticipate the evading side's route or to take shortcuts to intercept them.
- **Forced March**: The pursuing side may push themselves to move faster than normal, accepting fatigue or other penalties in exchange for the chance to catch the evading side.

## Resolving Evasion and Pursuit

The DM resolves evasion and pursuit using the following guidelines:

- **Simple Resolution**: For straightforward situations, the DM may resolve evasion and pursuit with a single check or comparison of movement rates, particularly if the outcome is clear or if detailed resolution would not add significantly to the game.
- **Detailed Resolution**: For more complex or significant situations, the DM may resolve evasion and pursuit in detail, tracking movement, applying modifiers for terrain and other factors, and allowing for specific tactics and countermeasures.
- **Player Agency**: The DM should allow players to make meaningful decisions during evasion and pursuit, such as choosing routes, employing tactics, or using resources, rather than reducing the situation to a single die roll.
- **NPC Decision-Making**: The DM should make decisions for NPCs and monsters based on their intelligence, nature, and motivations, creating realistic and consistent behavior.
- **Consequences**: The DM should consider the consequences of successful or failed evasion and pursuit, such as resource expenditure, time passage, or changes in the relationship between the parties.

## Conclusion

Evasion and pursuit add depth and dynamism to encounters in the AD&D game, providing alternatives to direct confrontation and creating opportunities for strategic thinking and resource management. The DM should handle evasion and pursuit in a way that is fair, consistent, and reflective of the specific circumstances of each situation. By considering the factors that affect evasion and pursuit and allowing for creative tactics and meaningful decisions, the DM can create more engaging and realistic encounters that reward player skill and tactical thinking.
