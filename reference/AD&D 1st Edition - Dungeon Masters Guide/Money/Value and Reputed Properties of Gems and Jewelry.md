## Determining Gem Value

The value of a specific gem depends on its type, size, quality, and cut:

- **Base Value**: Each type of gem has a base value, as listed above.
- **Size Modifier**: The size of the gem affects its value. Larger gems are worth more than smaller gems of the same type and quality.
- **Quality Modifier**: The quality of the gem affects its value. Flawless gems are worth more than flawed gems of the same type and size.
- **Cut Modifier**: The cut of the gem affects its value. Well-cut gems are worth more than poorly cut gems of the same type, size, and quality.

The DM should roll percentile dice and consult the following table to determine the actual value of a gem:

| Roll (d100) | Value Modifier |
|-------------|----------------|
| 01-25       | Base value × 0.5 |
| 26-75       | Base value × 1.0 |
| 76-95       | Base value × 1.5 |
| 96-00       | Base value × 2.0 |

## Types of Jewelry

Jewelry in the AD&D game includes various ornamental items made from precious metals, gems, and other materials:

- **Rings**: Circular bands worn on fingers, often set with gems.
- **Necklaces**: Chains or strings of gems worn around the neck.
- **Bracelets**: Circular bands worn on wrists, often set with gems.
- **Anklets**: Circular bands worn on ankles, often set with gems.
- **Earrings**: Ornaments worn on or through the earlobes.
- **Brooches**: Ornamental pins or clasps, often set with gems.
- **Crowns**: Ornamental headgear, often set with gems, symbolizing royalty or high status.
- **Tiaras**: Ornamental headbands, often set with gems, symbolizing high status.
- **Pendants**: Ornaments hung from necklaces, often set with gems.
- **Amulets**: Ornaments worn as protection against evil or harm, often set with gems.

## Determining Jewelry Value

The value of a specific piece of jewelry depends on its materials, craftsmanship, and cultural or historical significance:

- **Materials**: Jewelry made from precious metals (gold, silver, platinum) and set with valuable gems is worth more than jewelry made from common materials.
- **Craftsmanship**: Well-crafted jewelry is worth more than poorly crafted jewelry of the same materials.
- **Cultural or Historical Significance**: Jewelry with cultural or historical significance may be worth more than its material value would suggest.

The DM should determine the base value of a piece of jewelry based on its materials and craftsmanship, then adjust this value based on any cultural or historical significance.

## Reputed Properties of Gems

In many campaign settings, gems are reputed to have magical or mystical properties. These properties are not inherent magical abilities, but rather traditional beliefs about the gems' effects:

- **Azurite**: Reputed to enhance mental abilities and memory.
- **Amber**: Reputed to protect against disease and poison.
- **Amethyst**: Reputed to protect against drunkenness and to enhance wisdom.
- **Diamond**: Reputed to provide protection against all forms of poison and to enhance courage.
- **Emerald**: Reputed to reveal truth and to protect against enchantments.
- **Ruby**: Reputed to protect against fire and to enhance passion and courage.
- **Sapphire**: Reputed to protect against enchantments and to enhance mental clarity.

The DM may use these reputed properties as a basis for magical items, spell components, or cultural beliefs in the campaign.

## Gems and Jewelry as Treasure

Gems and jewelry are common components of treasure hoards in the AD&D game. The following guidelines apply:

- **Portability**: Gems and jewelry are more portable than an equivalent value in coins, making them attractive for characters who need to carry significant wealth.
- **Recognition**: The value of gems and jewelry may not be immediately apparent to characters without appropriate knowledge or skills. The DM may require Intelligence checks or similar rolls to accurately assess the value.
- **Marketability**: Gems and jewelry may be more difficult to sell than coins, particularly in small or remote settlements. The DM may require Charisma checks or similar rolls to find buyers, and may apply penalties to the sale price.
- **Cultural Significance**: Certain gems or pieces of jewelry may have cultural significance that affects their value or the reaction of NPCs. For example, wearing the royal jewels of a kingdom might provoke hostility from loyal subjects.

## Conclusion

Gems and jewelry add depth and variety to treasure in the AD&D game, providing alternatives to simple coin wealth. The DM should use these guidelines to handle the value and reputed properties of gems and jewelry in a way that enhances the game experience and provides interesting challenges and opportunities for the players.
