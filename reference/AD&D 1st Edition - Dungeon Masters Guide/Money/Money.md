*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

Money is a fundamental aspect of the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, representing the wealth and purchasing power of characters. This section provides an overview of the monetary system in the AD&D game and guidance for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling money in the campaign.

## The Monetary System

The AD&D game uses a monetary system based on coins of different metals, with the following standard denominations:

- **Copper Piece (cp)**: The basic unit of currency, equivalent to a penny or cent.
- **Silver Piece (sp)**: Worth 10 copper pieces.
- **Electrum Piece (ep)**: Worth 5 silver pieces or 50 copper pieces.
- **Gold Piece (gp)**: Worth 2 electrum pieces, 10 silver pieces, or 100 copper pieces.
- **Platinum Piece (pp)**: Worth 5 gold pieces, 10 electrum pieces, 50 silver pieces, or 500 copper pieces.

These values represent the standard exchange rates, but actual rates may vary by location and time in the campaign.

## Characteristics of Coins

Coins in the AD&D game have the following characteristics:

- **Weight**: Coins are relatively heavy, with 10 coins weighing approximately 1 pound. This means that characters carrying large amounts of coins may be encumbered.
- **Size**: Coins are relatively small, with a diameter of approximately 1 inch and a thickness of approximately 1/8 inch.
- **Appearance**: Coins typically have distinctive designs, often featuring the likeness of a ruler, a symbol of a city or nation, or a religious or cultural emblem.
- **Condition**: Coins may vary in condition, from newly minted to worn and tarnished. The condition of a coin generally does not affect its value, unless it is significantly damaged.

## Sources of Money

Characters can acquire money from various sources:

- **Starting Money**: New characters begin with a certain amount of money, determined by their class and possibly modified by other factors.
- **Treasure**: Characters can find money as part of treasure hoards, either in dungeons, wilderness areas, or other adventure locations.
- **Rewards**: Characters may receive money as rewards for completing quests, performing services, or otherwise assisting NPCs.
- **Income**: Characters may have sources of income, such as businesses, investments, or regular employment.
- **Theft**: Some characters, particularly thieves, may acquire money through theft or other illegal means.

## Uses of Money

Money can be used for various purposes in the game:

- **Equipment**: Characters can purchase weapons, armor, adventuring gear, and other equipment.
- **Services**: Characters can pay for services such as lodging, meals, transportation, or the services of hirelings or specialists.
- **Training**: Characters may need to pay for training to advance in level or to learn new skills.
- **Magical Items**: In some campaigns, magical items may be available for purchase, typically at high prices.
- **Lifestyle**: Characters may spend money to maintain a certain lifestyle, from modest to luxurious.
- **Investments**: Characters may invest money in businesses, property, or other ventures to generate income.
- **Donations**: Characters may donate money to temples, charities, or other organizations, potentially earning favor or other benefits.

## Managing Money in the Campaign

The DM should consider the following factors when managing money in the campaign:

- **Availability**: The DM should determine the availability of money in different parts of the campaign world. Some areas may be wealthy, with abundant coins, while others may be poor, with little currency in circulation.
- **Inflation and Deflation**: The DM should consider the effects of inflation and deflation on the value of money. If characters introduce large amounts of treasure into a local economy, prices may rise. Conversely, if money becomes scarce, prices may fall.
- **Alternative Currencies**: The DM may introduce alternative currencies, such as trade goods, promissory notes, or magical currencies, to add depth to the economic system.
- **Taxation**: The DM should consider the role of taxation in the campaign. Characters may be required to pay taxes on their income, wealth, or transactions.
- **Banking**: The DM should determine the availability and nature of banking services in the campaign. Characters may be able to deposit money for safekeeping, exchange currencies, or even take loans.

## Treasure and Wealth

The accumulation of treasure and wealth is a significant aspect of the AD&D game. The following guidelines apply:

- **Treasure Hoards**: Treasure hoards typically include a mix of coins, gems, jewelry, and possibly magical items. The composition of a hoard depends on the type of creature that accumulated it and the circumstances of its creation.
- **Wealth Distribution**: The DM should consider the distribution of wealth in the campaign world. Wealth may be concentrated in the hands of a few powerful individuals or organizations, or it may be more evenly distributed.
- **Wealth and Power**: Wealth often correlates with power in the campaign world. Wealthy characters may have access to resources, information, and influence that poorer characters lack.
- **Wealth and Alignment**: A character's alignment may influence their attitude toward wealth. For example, a lawful good character might view wealth as a means to help others, while a chaotic evil character might view it as a means to power and self-gratification.

## Conclusion

Money is a fundamental aspect of the AD&D game, providing a means for characters to acquire equipment, services, and other resources. The DM should use the monetary system as a tool to enhance the game experience, creating economic challenges and opportunities for the players.
