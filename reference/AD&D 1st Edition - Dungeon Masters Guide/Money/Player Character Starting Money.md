# Player Character Starting Money

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

When creating a new character in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, one of the important steps is determining the character's starting money. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling starting money for player characters.

## Starting Money by Class

The amount of starting money a character receives depends on their class. The following are the standard amounts:

- **Fighter**: 5-60 (5d12) gold pieces
- **Paladin**: 5-60 (5d12) gold pieces
- **Ranger**: 5-60 (5d12) gold pieces
- **Magic-User**: 2-20 (2d10) gold pieces
- **Illusionist**: 2-20 (2d10) gold pieces
- **Cleric**: 3-30 (3d10) gold pieces
- **Druid**: 3-30 (3d10) gold pieces
- **Thief**: 2-20 (2d10) gold pieces
- **Assassin**: 2-20 (2d10) gold pieces
- **Monk**: 5-20 (5d4) gold pieces
- **Bard**: 5-60 (5d12) gold pieces

These amounts represent the character's initial funds, which can be used to purchase equipment and supplies before beginning their adventures.

## Rolling for Starting Money

The DM should have each player roll the appropriate dice for their character's class to determine starting money. The following guidelines apply:

- **Open Rolls**: The rolls for starting money should typically be made openly, in view of the DM and other players.
- **No Rerolls**: Players should not be allowed to reroll for starting money, even if they roll poorly. The amount rolled represents the character's financial circumstances at the start of their adventuring career.
- **DM Discretion**: The DM may choose to allow all players to take the average amount for their class, rather than rolling, to ensure a more balanced start.

## Starting Money and Background

The amount of starting money can be interpreted in terms of the character's background:

- **High Rolls**: Characters who roll high amounts of starting money might come from wealthy families, have had successful previous careers, or have recently come into an inheritance or other windfall.
- **Low Rolls**: Characters who roll low amounts of starting money might come from poor families, have had unsuccessful previous careers, or have recently suffered financial setbacks.

The DM and players can use the starting money roll as a prompt for developing the character's background story.

## Purchasing Equipment

Characters use their starting money to purchase equipment before beginning their adventures. The following guidelines apply:

- **Equipment Lists**: The Players Handbook provides lists of equipment with standard prices. Characters can purchase items from these lists, subject to availability.
- **Availability**: The DM may determine that certain items are not available in the character's starting location, or are available only at higher prices.
- **Haggling**: The DM may allow characters to haggle over prices, potentially reducing the cost of equipment. This can be role-played or resolved with Charisma checks or similar mechanics.
- **Quality**: The DM may offer equipment of different quality levels at different prices. For example, a finely crafted sword might cost more than a standard sword but provide a bonus to attack rolls.

## Starting Money and Multi-Class Characters

For multi-class characters, the following guidelines apply:

- **Primary Class**: The character uses the starting money for their primary class (typically the class with the highest starting money).
- **Average**: The character uses the average of the starting money for all their classes.
- **Highest**: The character uses the starting money for the class with the highest starting money.

The DM should choose one of these methods and apply it consistently for all multi-class characters in the campaign.

## Starting Money and Level

The standard starting money amounts assume that characters are beginning at 1st level. For characters starting at higher levels, the following guidelines apply:

- **Proportional Increase**: The DM may increase starting money proportionally to the character's level. For example, a 3rd-level character might receive three times the normal starting money.
- **Equipment Value**: The DM may allow higher-level characters to begin with equipment of a total value appropriate to their level, rather than with cash.
- **Magical Items**: The DM may allow higher-level characters to begin with a limited number of magical items, in addition to or instead of additional money.

## Starting Money and Campaign Setting

The DM may adjust starting money based on the campaign setting:

- **Wealthy Settings**: In settings with abundant wealth and resources, the DM may increase starting money or reduce equipment prices.
- **Poor Settings**: In settings with scarce wealth and resources, the DM may decrease starting money or increase equipment prices.
- **Alternative Currencies**: In settings with alternative currencies, the DM may need to convert starting money to the appropriate currency.

## Conclusion

Starting money is an important aspect of character creation in the AD&D game, providing the means for characters to equip themselves for their adventures. The DM should use these guidelines to handle starting money in a way that is fair and consistent, while also considering the specific needs and themes of the campaign.
