# Player Character Expenses

*Extracted from the AD&D 1st Edition Dungeon Master's Guide*

In the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, player characters incur various expenses during their adventures and between adventures. This section provides guidelines for the Dungeon Master (DM) on handling player character expenses in the campaign.

## Types of Expenses

Player characters may incur various types of expenses:

- **Basic Necessities**: Food, drink, and lodging are the most basic expenses. Characters need to eat and sleep, and while they might be able to camp in the wilderness or sleep in stables, comfortable accommodations cost money.
- **Equipment Maintenance**: Weapons, armor, and other equipment require maintenance to remain in good condition. This includes sharpening weapons, repairing armor, replacing worn components, and similar tasks.
- **Transportation**: Characters may need to pay for transportation, such as horses, wagons, ships, or magical means of travel.
- **Services**: Characters may pay for various services, such as healing, information, guidance, or specialized skills they lack.
- **Hirelings and Henchmen**: Characters may employ hirelings for specific tasks or henchmen as long-term followers, both of which require payment.
- **Training**: Characters may need to pay for training to advance in level or to learn new skills.
- **Taxes and Fees**: Characters may be subject to various taxes and fees, such as gate taxes, bridge tolls, or guild dues.
- **Lifestyle**: Characters may choose to maintain a certain lifestyle, from modest to luxurious, which incurs ongoing expenses.

## Basic Necessities

The cost of basic necessities varies depending on quality and location:

- **Food and Drink**: A simple meal might cost a few copper pieces, while a lavish feast might cost several gold pieces per person. The quality of food and drink affects not only the cost but also the nutrition and satisfaction provided.
- **Lodging**: Basic lodging, such as a spot on the common room floor of an inn, might cost a few copper pieces per night. A private room might cost a silver piece or more, while luxurious accommodations might cost several gold pieces per night.
- **Clothing**: Simple clothing might cost a few silver pieces, while fine clothing might cost several gold pieces or more. Specialized clothing, such as cold weather gear or formal attire, might cost even more.

## Equipment Maintenance

The cost of equipment maintenance depends on the type and quality of the equipment:

- **Weapons**: Maintaining weapons typically costs about 1% of the weapon's value per month. This includes sharpening, polishing, and minor repairs.
- **Armor**: Maintaining armor typically costs about 2% of the armor's value per month. This includes cleaning, oiling, and minor repairs.
- **Other Equipment**: Maintaining other equipment typically costs about 1-5% of the equipment's value per month, depending on the complexity and fragility of the equipment.

Neglecting equipment maintenance can lead to penalties or equipment failure. The DM may impose penalties to attack rolls for poorly maintained weapons, penalties to armor class for poorly maintained armor, or increased chances of equipment failure for other poorly maintained equipment.

## Transportation

The cost of transportation depends on the method and distance:

- **Land Travel**: Horses, mules, wagons, and similar means of land travel have purchase costs and ongoing maintenance costs. For example, a riding horse might cost 100 gold pieces to purchase and 5 gold pieces per month to maintain.
- **Water Travel**: Ships and boats have passage fees or charter costs. For example, passage on a merchant ship might cost 1-5 gold pieces per day, while chartering a small ship might cost 10-50 gold pieces per day.
- **Magical Travel**: Magical means of travel, such as teleportation spells or flying carpets, may have costs in terms of spell components, magical energy, or payment to spellcasters.

## Services

The cost of services depends on the type and quality of the service:

- **Healing**: Healing services, such as those provided by clerics or healers, may cost 10-100 gold pieces or more, depending on the severity of the injury or illness and the power of the healing.
- **Information**: Information services, such as those provided by sages or spies, may cost 1-100 gold pieces or more, depending on the rarity and value of the information.
- **Guidance**: Guidance services, such as those provided by guides or scouts, may cost 1-10 gold pieces per day, depending on the danger and difficulty of the terrain.
- **Specialized Skills**: Services requiring specialized skills, such as blacksmithing, carpentry, or magical item creation, may cost 1-100 gold pieces or more, depending on the complexity and time required.

## Hirelings and Henchmen

The cost of hirelings and henchmen depends on their skills and the dangers they face:

- **Hirelings**: Hirelings are employees who perform specific tasks for payment. Their wages depend on their skills and the risks involved. For example, a porter might earn 1 silver piece per day, while a skilled guide might earn 1 gold piece per day or more.
- **Henchmen**: Henchmen are followers who accompany the character on adventures and share in the risks and rewards. They typically receive a share of treasure in addition to basic support (food, lodging, equipment).

## Training

The cost of training depends on the level being attained and the class of the character:

- **Level Advancement**: Characters typically need to spend time and money training to advance in level. The cost is typically 1,500 gold pieces per level being attained, multiplied by the number of weeks of training required (typically 1-4 weeks).
- **Class Differences**: Different classes may have different training costs or requirements. For example, magic-users might need to spend more on rare components or texts, while fighters might need to spend more on weapons and practice equipment.

## Taxes and Fees

The types and amounts of taxes and fees depend on the campaign setting:

- **Gate Taxes**: Cities may charge taxes for entering or leaving through their gates. These might be flat fees or percentages of the value of goods being transported.
- **Bridge Tolls**: Bridges may charge tolls for crossing. These are typically small amounts, such as a few copper pieces per person or per wagon.
- **Guild Dues**: Characters who belong to guilds may need to pay dues. These might be annual fees or percentages of income earned through guild-related activities.
- **Property Taxes**: Characters who own property may be subject to property taxes. These might be annual fees based on the value of the property.

## Lifestyle

The cost of maintaining a certain lifestyle depends on the level of luxury:

- **Subsistence**: A subsistence lifestyle, with minimal food, shelter, and clothing, might cost 1-2 gold pieces per month.
- **Modest**: A modest lifestyle, with adequate food, shelter, and clothing, might cost 5-10 gold pieces per month.
- **Comfortable**: A comfortable lifestyle, with good food, private lodging, and quality clothing, might cost 20-50 gold pieces per month.
- **Wealthy**: A wealthy lifestyle, with excellent food, spacious lodging, and fine clothing, might cost 100-200 gold pieces per month.
- **Aristocratic**: An aristocratic lifestyle, with the best of everything, might cost 500-1,000 gold pieces per month or more.

## Conclusion

Player character expenses add realism and economic challenges to the AD&D game. The DM should use these guidelines to handle expenses in a way that is realistic and consistent, while also considering the specific needs and themes of the campaign. By requiring characters to manage their finances, the DM can create additional dimensions of challenge and role-playing opportunity.
