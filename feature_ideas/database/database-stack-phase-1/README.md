# Database Stack Architecture - Phase 1: Infrastructure Design

This directory contains the infrastructure design documents and scripts for Phase 1 of the RPGer database stack architecture implementation.

## Overview

Phase 1 focuses on designing the foundational components of the database stack, including:

1. Docker Compose configuration
2. Volume structure for persistent storage
3. Network topology and security
4. Resource requirements and scaling considerations
5. Initialization and health check scripts

## Documents

### [Docker Compose Configuration](docker-compose-config.md)

This document outlines the Docker Compose configuration for the RPGer database stack, focusing on creating a robust, maintainable, and scalable database infrastructure. It includes:

- Service definitions for MongoDB, Redis, and Chroma
- Volume configurations for persistent storage
- Network settings for secure communication
- Environment variables for customization
- Admin interfaces for database management

### [Volume Structure](volume-structure.md)

This document details the volume structure for persistent storage in the RPGer database stack, ensuring data persistence across container restarts and system rebuilds. It covers:

- Volume design for each database service
- Directory structure for organized data storage
- Backup and restoration procedures
- Scaling considerations for production deployments

### [Network Topology](network-topology.md)

This document describes the network topology and security considerations for the RPGer database stack. It includes:

- Network architecture diagram
- Port exposure configuration
- Security measures for authentication and encryption
- Network isolation strategies
- Integration with the application stack

### [Resource Requirements](resource-requirements.md)

This document outlines the resource requirements and scaling considerations for the RPGer database stack. It covers:

- Resource allocation for development and production environments
- Performance tuning recommendations
- Scaling strategies (vertical and horizontal)
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Scripts

### Initialization Scripts

- **[mongodb-init.js](init-scripts/mongodb-init.js)**: Initializes the MongoDB database with collections, indexes, and users
- **[redis-init.sh](init-scripts/redis-init.sh)**: Sets up Redis with configuration parameters and initial data structures

### Health Check Scripts

- **[database-health-check.sh](health-check-scripts/database-health-check.sh)**: Checks the health of all database services and provides detailed status information

### Backup Scripts

- **[backup-scheduler.sh](backup-scripts/backup-scheduler.sh)**: Schedules and manages backups for all database services with rotation policies

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 1 (Infrastructure Design), the project will move to:

1. **Phase 2: Database Stack Implementation**
   - Set up MongoDB container with persistent storage
   - Configure Redis container with appropriate persistence settings
   - Deploy Chroma container with vector storage volume
   - Implement internal networking between containers
   - Configure resource limits and restart policies

2. **Phase 3: Backup and Recovery System**
   - Implement automated backup system
   - Create backup verification procedures
   - Develop disaster recovery documentation
   - Test restoration processes

3. **Phase 4: Monitoring and Management**
   - Set up monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)
   - Create alerting system
   - Develop management scripts
   - Document operational procedures

## Usage

The documents and scripts in this directory serve as a design reference for implementing the RPGer database stack. The actual implementation will be carried out in Phase 2.
