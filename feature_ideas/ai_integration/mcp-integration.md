# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration for RPGer

## Overview

This document outlines a proposed feature enhancement for the RPGer project by integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend AI agent capabilities and provide structured access to game content, workflows, commands, and AD&D 1st Edition reference materials.

Model Context Protocol is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI models to securely connect with external data sources and tools. It creates a standardized way for AI assistants to access real-time data, execute functions in external systems, and interact with specialized tools and services.

## Business Value

Implementing MCP servers for RPG agents would provide the following benefits:

1. **Enhanced AI Agent Capabilities**: Enable AI agents to access specialized tools and game content, making them more powerful and versatile.
2. **Improved User Experience**: Provide more accurate, consistent, and detailed responses to player actions.
3. **Reduced Token Usage**: Offload specialized knowledge to external servers, reducing prompt sizes and potentially lowering API costs.
4. **Scalability**: Allow for modular expansion of game features without increasing complexity in the core AI prompts.
5. **Future-Proofing**: Align with emerging industry standards for AI tool integration.
6. **Efficient Access to AD&D Materials**: Provide structured access to AD&D 1st Edition reference materials through a standardized interface.

## Decision

After evaluating the capabilities of MCP and the requirements of the RPGer system, a **multi-tier MCP architecture** is recommended to leverage existing MongoDB and Redis containers while adding specialized vector search capabilities.

## Proposed MCP Server Types

### 1. Game Content Server

**Purpose**: Provide access to game content stored in the Game_Play folder.

**Tools**:
- `list_campaigns`: List available campaigns
- `get_campaign_details`: Get details about a specific campaign
- `get_location`: Get information about a location
- `get_npc`: Get information about an NPC or monster
- `get_character`: Get information about a player character
- `get_rules`: Get game rules or house rules
- `get_session`: Get session records

**Example Use Case**: The Dungeon Master Agent (DMA) can request detailed information about a location or NPC without needing this information in its prompt.

### 2. Rules Reference Server

**Purpose**: Provide accurate rule interpretations and lookups for the game system.

**Features**:
- Query game rules by category, action type, or keyword
- Retrieve specific rule text and page references
- Interpret rule interactions and edge cases
- Support multiple game systems/editions

**Example Use Case**: When a player attempts an unusual action, the DMA can query the Rules Reference Server to determine the correct mechanics to apply.

### 3. Workflow Server

**Purpose**: Guide RPG agents through structured workflows for character creation, combat, magic, exploration, etc.

**Tools**:
- `list_workflows`: List available workflows
- `get_workflow`: Get details about a specific workflow
- `get_workflow_phase`: Get details about a specific phase in a workflow
- `transition_workflow`: Transition from one workflow to another
- `update_game_state`: Update the current game state

**Example Use Case**: The Combat Resolution Agent (CRA) can follow a structured combat workflow, ensuring that all steps are performed in the correct order according to AD&D rules.

### 4. Combat Resolution Server

**Purpose**: Handle complex combat mechanics and dice rolling.

**Features**:
- Process attack rolls, damage calculations, and saving throws
- Track initiative and combat order
- Apply status effects and condition tracking
- Calculate probabilities for different combat outcomes

**Example Use Case**: During combat, the DMA can offload the mechanical resolution to this server, focusing instead on narrative description.

### 5. World Generation Server

**Purpose**: Create and maintain consistent world elements.

**Features**:
- Generate locations, NPCs, and items with consistent details
- Maintain relationships between world elements
- Provide contextual information about the game world
- Support for different campaign settings

**Example Use Case**: When players enter a new town, the server can generate consistent details about the location, its inhabitants, and available services.

### 6. Character Management Server

**Purpose**: Track and manage player character information.

**Features**:
- Store and retrieve character sheets and statistics
- Calculate derived attributes and abilities
- Track inventory, equipment, and resources
- Manage character progression and advancement

**Example Use Case**: The CMA can query this server to access up-to-date character information when making decisions about character actions or abilities.

### 7. Narrative Engine Server

**Purpose**: Generate consistent and engaging narrative elements.

**Features**:
- Create plot hooks and story developments
- Generate descriptive text for environments and actions
- Maintain narrative consistency and theme
- Track story arcs and character development

**Example Use Case**: The DMA can request atmospheric descriptions or plot developments that align with the current campaign themes.

### 8. Command Server

**Purpose**: Execute commands via the existing MCP scripts to control the RPG web app.

**Tools**:
- `start_game`: Start the RPG web app
- `stop_game`: Stop the RPG web app
- `save_game`: Save the current game state
- `load_game`: Load a saved game state
- `get_logs`: Get application logs

**Example Use Case**: The DMA can save the current game state at critical points in the adventure or load a previously saved state.

## Recommended Approach

A **multi-tier MCP architecture** that integrates with existing infrastructure:

1. **Primary MCP Server**
   - Deploy MongoDB MCP Server with vector search capabilities

- **Character Data**: Secure storage for player character information

## Persistence and Backup Strategy

To ensure data persistence and enable container rebuilds with preseeded data:

1. **Permanent MCP Database Infrastructure**
   - Deploy MCP servers and their underlying databases as a permanent stack
   - Separate this infrastructure from the RPG application components
   - Configure with persistent volume mounts for all data storage
   - Use Docker Compose with defined volumes for each database

2. **Backup Automation**
   - Implement scheduled MongoDB dumps for structured data
   - Back up Chroma's vector store directory
   - Create Redis RDB snapshots at regular intervals
   - Store all backups in a designated backup volume with rotation policy

3. **MCP Server Preseeding**
   - Create initialization scripts for each MCP server
   - Automatically detect empty databases during startup
   - Restore from latest backups when containers are rebuilt
   - Include version checking for schema compatibility

4. **Application Architecture**
   - Configure RPG application to connect to MCP servers via internal network
   - Use environment variables for MCP server endpoints
   - Implement connection pooling and retry logic
   - Add health checks to verify MCP server availability
